1
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.780
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Welcome everybody sorry we have minor delay. This is my kids.

2
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.889
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Hopefully, everybody had a great weekend.

3
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.110
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Summer flew by very quickly.

4
00:00:42.840 --> 00:01:08.789
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Cool. So let's do this. Let's go through. Today's live coaching. I see a lot of people join us already. Welcome, welcome, all right. So make sure to turn on your camera if you can, so I can see all my students beautiful faces when I teach, so I don't feel I'm teaching talking to empty blank screens. Okay? So now let's get started. Let me

5
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.780
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: share screen

6
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:29.479
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: get started right? Now, cool. Okay. So today we cover module 5 process. Interview. Any. I want to put quick upfront guidance regarding if you are new, do not feel like Oh, my goodness, why start from Module 5.

7
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:42.179
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And the way we teach our word program is 5, 8 modules in a loop. So numbers doesn't mean the prerequisite for any of the modules. You can actually get started with

8
00:01:42.180 --> 00:02:06.929
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Module 8 for Senior Pm. Or for aspiring. Pm. We recommend people start from modules 3 and 4, each person a different kind of study paths. Usually, when you come into news assessment, we'll tell you which one to get started first.st However, all you need to do is when starting module. 5. You only need to study the prep. Training for Module 5. Before you get started with me. Live, however, even if you miss the prep. Training module 5. Just go back to watch recordings.

9
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:30.100
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: The prep training of each module is me just reading through the slides which the other slides machine with you going through all the slides all together. Okay, so. But I learned that the best way for me to spend variables on it, like all of us together, is actually doing live case studies. So therefore, if you miss the Prep training, make sure to watch it after the session ideally, watch it before we get started. Okay? So now.

10
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:38.400
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: without further ado, let's get started regarding all the important lessons today we cover process. Interview

11
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:56.170
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: is a standard interview for upper managers. Regardless you interview for fan companies or unicorn startups. And now it's literally everybody trying to model after the Fan company started from fan companies. Now, everybody want to model after that, and even Openai ask

12
00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:11.960
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: the same type of interview questions, but they make it more challenging. They make it 30 min instead of 45 min, and I also have seen a trend of those interviewing questions. They make it even shorter. We have seen cases that they ask 3

13
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:24.770
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: cases or 3 framework within 1, 45 min questions since they're going really fast. Okay, not just for Fan Company. I want to make it clear, not just for Fan company. Even, for example, capital. One has to enjoy capital. One has several students

14
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:53.340
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: joined Kevin one recently, and they ask you multiple questions within the same 45 min questions, but that lead to like 3 different framework, which will teach you the framework are covered in Module 5 and 6 altogether, and we have in our program has so many different framework and module, had different another Gucci framework as well, so many framework. But it's literally the interview process start getting harder and harder. To be frank, because it's employers. Market AI already replaced 25% of the entry level jobs last year

15
00:03:53.710 --> 00:04:15.470
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: this year Senior. Pm's also going through all the layoffs like competition nowadays. Not just Pm's anything I also have seen like undergrad mit Stanford undergrad studied computer science reaching out to us. And hey, do you know any job opportunities? It was pretty crap if you go to Mit Stanford. Okay, so it's not just part management as a profession, the whole tech

16
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:34.350
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: because AI is replacing jobs out there. So that's why the interview bar is higher. So therefore I want to train you up, train you guys up to get ready for all the interview challenges. Okay? So it's just more competitive. Say less jobs and generates less jobs out there. Okay for both senior and aspiring, aspiring and like

17
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:42.399
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: less jobs. But senior people is more like, you have competitions. So that's the reason behind it. Okay? But regardless.

18
00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:55.780
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: we must go through this, this change of the industry right now, not just applying for our industries all places, and changing. So without further ado, let's make sure to apply everything, teach you today and get very sharp and best answers.

19
00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:19.690
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: All right so, and feel free to go to celebration channel. We have lots of great progress in the celebration channel and feel free to go there and also learn from other people who also have very similar backgrounds, just like you, and to speed up the process. I'm not going to talk about Jason's, and he recently joined Amazon as a senior Pm. As entrepreneur. But I do want to tell one inspiring story each time. When I teach, and I do time myself.

20
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:28.269
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: When I teach, I want to wrap up everything within few minutes before we dive into the live cases together. Okay, so now. But I do want to show you

21
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:54.929
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Jamie Karen Lima's story because she's my role model. Whenever I see challenges, I literally will think about what she does. Okay, so this is her story. She was the CEO of it. Cosmetics. If you go, Sephora, all those cosmetics, brand. You will see it. Cosmetics. Okay? And then this brand was sold to Sd. Lauder for a billion dollars, and then she became the Sd. Lauder's 1st

22
00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:06.750
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: female CEO. And then recently, she didn't join them. She want to pursue her different passions. But the important story I want to share with you guys is her

23
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.724
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: objections. How many objections she had. So this, really, it's a cosmetic brand. Okay?

24
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.120
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you know, it's blue ocean strategy.

25
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:42.369
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: cosmetic brand. Everybody, so many different brands competition for cosmetic brand, the makeup stuff or craziest crazy crazy. Okay, so early in her year she was just bootstrapping her cosmetics brand in Chicago and was in 2 years, with no income, with her husband altogether working on the same brand, and she literally was rejected by over 1,000 Vcs. Didn't want to invest in her company, and one day she got a phone call

26
00:06:42.370 --> 00:07:03.080
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and the Vc. Said, Can you come into San Francisco office? I want to tell you this news in person, and she was oh, my goodness! This is the one this is when someone finally decided to invest in a company. So she bought the cheapest fries you can ever find from Chicago flying to San Francisco, and then, when she got to the Vc. Office, the Vc. Pulled her on the side

27
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.011
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and start saying, You know what?

28
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:14.019
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I don't want to tell you this in like over the phone, and I just want to tell you the the truth.

29
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:26.040
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and I think will help you significantly. We decide not to invest in your company because we don't think people buy cosmetic brand makeup brand from someone who look like you.

30
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:32.089
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: This is crazy. Let's read. It's like you said it to any woman, basically saying that she's just not as good looking.

31
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:37.669
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I think it's very insulting. Anybody. Say this and then she just really like

32
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:53.470
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: ball out crying in the hallway just like crying. It's like crazy has been so many rejections. Now, it's like people saying that I'm not pretty enough. Which kind of shoe and all the consume brands. You know all the models like this. By the way, all these models on Instagram, they are Photoshopped

33
00:07:53.670 --> 00:08:03.950
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Photoshop models, not even real models. Okay? Now, they have AI models. Okay? So they all look like this. But it's true. Very few people look like her. Okay, so

34
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:26.759
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: here is what she did. Of course it took her like several days to recover from this very, very insulting statement. And then she took a very different approach. So she finally got opportunity to have like, 10 min on Qvc. Qbc, basically is a live shopping show like television shopping show. You talk about your product. People can. Just

35
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:40.759
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I make a phone call and place orders. Is that crazy, and the way she decide to sell her product in through different ways was that she went into the show with full makeup on, and she started to describe, saying that

36
00:08:41.120 --> 00:09:09.110
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you know what. So I like this with my makeup, and let me remove my makeup. Show you what I look like before the makeup, and she'll remove her makeup. And then she look like this. So basically, she has, like some woman has those kind of conditional skin that in her words. It's called sandpaper skin, just like lots of red spots. It's not naturally great and literally other type of makeup on her face gonna fall off, or her her face, because her face was so dry. It's a sandpaper skin. But

37
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:29.019
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: after she described before and after after removing the the makeup, and literally herself start to take off, and people start to see the authentic person who she is, and also understand how strong, how great the cosmetic brand look like. Okay, so I want you to start. Reflect

38
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:33.380
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: anytime in your career and job hunting journey.

39
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:40.159
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Did the job market or other people

40
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.820
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: in your life? Tell you what you cannot do.

41
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:54.999
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, in that situation happen. I want you to do this. I want to find one role model and start to ask yourself, what would my role model do?

42
00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:10.509
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Hey? Let's say you pick somebody, Vanessa. I don't think you can become a Pm. There will be people saying that I have. Someone said to me in my face in San Francisco, I don't think you're the entrepreneurial type. I literally someone said it to me.

43
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:16.509
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: okay. And then, years later middle finger, you know. So. But

44
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:39.839
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you will see people like that. Okay, so ignore. Okay, there will be people like this telling you what you can do what you cannot do. Sometimes it's out of a frank advice, saying, Nancy, don't waste your time. I think it's better you stay in your lane right sometimes it's for very friendly advice. Okay, but I want you to understand anytime through an entire job hunting process.

45
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:55.549
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Even if you get rejections, what other people tell you can or cannot do. Sometimes you feel like you're perfect fit for the job, and you want to find wrong interview. And I was like, Oh, no, you're not the right one. And then you didn't get didn't get offered. Okay, in the situation happened. Just

46
00:10:56.050 --> 00:11:02.510
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: pick one role model and very simple. Just like, what would my role model do when she got rejected?

47
00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:04.829
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And the answer is very clear.

48
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:09.029
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: When I see challenges, I would ask myself, what would

49
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:19.339
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Jamie Karenima do? If she got rejected, or she got this kind of setback setback, would she just say, Give up?

50
00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:24.650
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Or would she just say, Let me keep working on it and give another try.

51
00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:27.250
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: The answer will be very simple.

52
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:46.479
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and also what she also represent. It's like, let's really not just say all the good looking women like Instagram models, and lots of people just look at her like normal women look like her. Didn't get a chance to really show up their beauty as well. There's lots of motivations and reason behind what you want to do, why you want to do it as well.

53
00:11:47.230 --> 00:12:02.770
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay. So therefore, I know this job hunting process is very challenging and sometimes out of control. As I said earlier, AI is replacing jobs, not just Pm, software engineer from Mit couldn't earn a job. It's like blew my mind from Stanford mit like crazy. Okay? So

54
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.310
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: when market wasn't doing well

55
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:16.799
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: when you face challenges or objections, go back and find your own role models, deep jobs, whatever. Find a name, and ask yourself, what would

56
00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:23.240
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: this person do? Your answer will be very straightforward, very simple. Lots of time is a mindset

57
00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:34.190
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: that help hold you back. Not you don't know the right strategies. Okay, if you don't know the right strategies, what to say in the interviews. Resume all of these.

58
00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:49.809
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Please come to my team. Come to me to my office hours. We'll we're more than happy to help you out. That's why we schedule weekly daily mock interviews to help you guys out. I have full team supporting you. All right. So therefore find role models. And whenever you see challenges, just

59
00:12:50.490 --> 00:13:02.389
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: ask this important question, what would she or he do? Okay, then you have a very, you answer very clear. And then all the strategies and execution practical part come to me and all the mindset. I want you to find your role models.

60
00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:24.470
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and it is going to help you to stay strong in this, every channel. Okay, cool. So now let's continue. And we do have a referral program. And we believe the best program in the industry. We do see a lot of alumni always refer their friends here. So if you refer, any friend, your friend got additional $20 discount, and you can exchange it for one-on-one coaching or

61
00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:51.110
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Amazon gift card or additional one year. Kajabi access after you. Land a job. Okay? Cool, all right. And Aipm bookcam currently for Pma kids is ongoing right now. If you want to continue volunteer and reach out to Karen at Pmsrio, we currently have, I think, have 5 mentors teaching Pma Aipm book and kids for free right now. So reach out to them. And so now let's do this case interviews as I mentioned earlier.

62
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:52.880
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I'll send this

63
00:13:53.280 --> 00:14:00.139
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: all the interview questions being asked by these type of companies. And today I'm going to go through this modified circles framework

64
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:11.469
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: very critical. I want to. I want to emphasize modified circles framework. I invented many framework, and this specific framework is modified circles, framework. Okay? And I also recorded

65
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:35.229
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: the new video of me reading through the slides. Okay, so make sure you watch the Prep training before and after this live training of me, reading through the slides which I'm showing you right now. Okay, it's very effective. Once you start to implement our strategies. So today we do live cases, the way we do it is let me do this. Let me use 30 seconds and show you, what do I mean by modified circles framework.

66
00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:52.500
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and then we just apply this framework and directly go into the case. Interview today. Original. This is a circles framework, for I lose Lynn like over 10 years ago, but I modified it to reflect on today's ever-changing job market right now.

67
00:14:52.700 --> 00:15:03.700
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay. And also help you how to answer questions much faster and think about things much faster instead of just going freestyle. Okay? So so now go through this in 30 seconds.

68
00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:10.039
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Comprehend situation straightforward what it's about. But when you comprehend the situation.

69
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:22.479
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: understand the current mission of company, and how we like to the current situation. Such a covid or post covid right now, or post covid or inflation right now where we have inflation. And also right now, like AI replacing jobs.

70
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:38.159
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: 25% of jobs replaced last year for the entry level job. Senior. Pm, non. Pm, any kind of senior jobs right now. They're going through a rework and layoff right now. It is a competition everywhere, right now. So you can think about. Of course.

71
00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:54.379
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: that's a job, honey market. Right? So if you do a case regarding, let's say, grocery design grocery store. This also matter interview, question, design a grocery store as an example. Right? And you talk about inflation price going up right? So talk about the current situation you're in.

72
00:15:54.600 --> 00:16:15.520
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Emphasize the customers and talk about. Oh, yeah, groceries. No wonder we need to redesign grocery store so expensive going grocery shopping nowadays, and like inflation is high and interest rate is high, there's and then when you go to grocery stores, you can mention several challenges as customers, for example, hard to find

73
00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:32.329
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: things, and then also, like maybe price comparison, and some of the the new needs that customers has as well so high level, comprehensive situation all right, and then feel free to ask clarifying questions. Now let me let me emphasize. Current questions are scoping question.

74
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:45.710
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But all is this, for international market or us? Market is is all of the. You can make a scoping question. The Korean Fan question anything you want to ask. The interviewer can go here, but you cannot ask the interviewer to solve the case for you

75
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:53.989
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: or may create. Okay, what do I mean? Do not ask your customer. Oh, design the grocery store. Do you want to design it? For.

76
00:16:54.280 --> 00:17:07.630
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: like a urban grocery store or high-end grocery store like a whole foods. What type of grocery store you want to design? No, no, no, no, do not ask the question. It's part of your customer segmentation, which is here

77
00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.200
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: next part from identify customers.

78
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:18.790
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, so don't ask them to solve the case for you, because next step you need to go through the identified customer. But identify customer here means customer segmentation.

79
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:26.259
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay? And then we'll also go through 2 set, 2 set of market place framework. We identify customers very straightforward, which means

80
00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:31.170
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: any things microphone. But use the easy one.

81
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:41.030
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Uber Uber has uber riders, uber driver drivers, riders, 2 side marketplace microphone, 2 sides. Me speaker, you listener.

82
00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:44.249
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: 99% product had 2 sides.

83
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:57.559
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, 1% chance may not be. But just just, I guarantee you, 99% chance something on product has 2 side marketplace. Okay, so which I have this I give in in the

84
00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:01.070
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: prep training. I believe that's

85
00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:15.790
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: 20 min. Video goes through this in depth. Here, I just give you a quick overview because I want to solve case together in case not everybody watch prep training. Okay? So and then to summarine rays, watch this. I explain more different examples. So to set marketplace and sub customer segmentation and 2 sides

86
00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:20.410
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: after 2 sides. Say, microphone speakers and listeners, what type of speakers.

87
00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:28.670
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: what type of listeners? And you can continue to sub customer segmentation. And then you can't prioritize. So now I want to highlight important things.

88
00:18:30.256 --> 00:18:34.629
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Cut prioritization. I gave you the framework here.

89
00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:44.929
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You must stick to the framework, feel free to add additional things to the framework, but do not eliminate things on the framework for them. I gave you 3 things in the framework.

90
00:18:45.310 --> 00:19:06.139
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You can add 4 things, the 5th one, the 4th one, the 5th one to the framework, to prioritize your customers. But do not be oh, we should remove urgency. We should remove impact. I'm sorry you got to include these 3 things. Okay, prioritization, including impact as market urgency. And then in the prep training, I have definition.

91
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:10.229
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: This definition is the exact things you need to say during the interviews

92
00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:20.009
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: this week. Copy paste. This will say the exact same thing. You will pass. People ask, what do you mean by impact? Oh, means which I show you on the slides? Okay. Now

93
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:30.330
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and then you continue cut prioritize your oops. Hold on, why have 2 sides? Okay? By the way, high level.

94
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:35.719
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you cut prioritize twice. One is highest level customer segmentation. Let's say you did not make a phone.

95
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:39.689
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Do you design for speaker like me, or design for listener like you?

96
00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.709
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So you pick one side, 1st using impact as market urgency.

97
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.040
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, then you do subcustomer segmentation prioritization

98
00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.140
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: for the site marketplace. You select it.

99
00:19:54.120 --> 00:20:01.120
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You prioritize twice within customer segmentation because we're sub customer segmentation. Okay? Then

100
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:09.809
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: report customer needs which is listing your needs and pain. Point usually interview 3 is a golden number. During the interview. You need to give me 3 good ones.

101
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:12.240
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You have 2. Try to have 3.

102
00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:23.449
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: If you have 10, it's not necessary. Try to have 3 or 5, you know. If you do have 5, you can keep 5. Okay, I just tell you.

103
00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:45.869
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: 3 is golden number during the interviews. Okay? And then you prioritize your needs urgencies using the new framework called pen level size, opportunity urgency, and I have description here in the slides and also in the prep. Training. All right, and then list your solutions, one to 3 again, 3 is a golden number in the interview. One or 3 should be moonshot idea if you go for Google.

104
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:53.200
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But if you do not go for Google, you are not required to have moonshot id.

105
00:20:53.700 --> 00:21:15.210
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But nowadays, almost by default, the moonshot idea is something related to AI. To be frank, so almost everybody can create moonshot idea nowadays, because it's like this is a shortcut to it. Okay? And then you do the estimating trade-off for all your 3 ideas. Solution 1, 2, 3, and then I give you framework here as well. Effectiveness.

106
00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:32.439
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: engineering effort, ease of implementation, risk. And I have another slide detailing what's what each means. And all of these users doing interview, and again feel free to add more things to it. Let's say you do self-driving car company. You can add safety, standard or regulation

107
00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.340
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: as one of the like

108
00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:44.600
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: right as one of the trade-offs of your different solutions.

109
00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:53.920
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: because self-driving car regulation right? So you can add more to this thing if you want to, but do not remove things from the framework.

110
00:21:54.120 --> 00:22:09.759
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, add more, feel free to do so, but it depends on the case. But this, this the framework covers 80% of those cases out there. Okay? And if I go to interview, I'm going to stick to my framework without even adding new things to it, because this can almost solve all different cases anyway.

111
00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:27.620
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: All right. And but for people want to modify, I don't want to constrain you. Okay? So that's why give you room to play with it. But do not. Do not remove this. You can add more if you want to, and then you finally save some time, maybe one or 2 min into. We're going to have you to design Mvp.

112
00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:44.600
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I suggest people to use the fastest way to join Mep on piece of paper. I've experimented this before. If you do a piece of paper, it's like, Oh, what does it look like? A microphone. I draw a picture microphone whatever, but a new microphone whatever, and stick to the screen, to the interviewer it's much faster.

113
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:55.650
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Then you do something. Fancy figma like no, as I mentioned nowadays, the trend is, they do 3 framework within 1, 45 min interview, but not all of them some companies.

114
00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:05.719
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and started doing 3 framework. It's like crazy, too much going on. So I'm not. Not only I want to teach you guys to solve the case, but also want you to be smart

115
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:06.630
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and

116
00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:32.159
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: efficient. Say the right thing in the interview, so that you can pass interview faster in case they give you 3 cases. Okay. So now let's do this together oops those. I also have prep training. We're going to help you stand out. That's a prep training. Please make sure to watch this all different things. I have pre-recorded, difficult mistakes. I pre-recorded training as well. All of these. We have done all those cases before.

117
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:39.220
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay. All those different different case, different case work from home disabilities, all like all possible things. Today, we do travel.

118
00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:47.870
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: design and travel app for Facebook. Do this one. So let me show my, where is

119
00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:50.690
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: discussion? Let me do this.

120
00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:04.360
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, so everybody go here and go to office hour Sunday right here.

121
00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:20.389
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Alright, you're able to see all our homework here. Okay, so my ta is going to post all those reminders. What we teach on Sunday office hours to check the case, study questions ahead of time

122
00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:21.850
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and think about it.

123
00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:32.139
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Think about ahead of time. Okay. By the way, each of those cases we pick is in the case. Interview library, that 2,000 case interview libraries in your module. 2.

124
00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:56.359
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay for fan interview. There's so many different interview questions also based on real interview questions from like Meta. So they ask you design travel for Facebook. All the cases are real things. I don't make up random cases. Okay, so this is what they have asked in the past. And also travel is something very fun nowadays. Okay, so a lot of people like to design the travel app in general. Okay? So now and then you should think about your answers ahead of time.

125
00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:04.849
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: like people already submitted the homework. Think about it. There's no right or wrong answer. There is a right answer. To be frank.

126
00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:13.299
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: when you do homework you won't be judged in terms of you didn't give me right answers. It's okay. But that's why here to learn. Okay. But once you think about ahead of time.

127
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:31.610
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: okay, it's going to help you to get the juices flowing. Think about it, so that you know what part of your answers is not as good when we teach this live case together, and then I can also provide live feedback regarding any important teaching moment

128
00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:40.490
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: we can learn together, because some, sometimes some mistakes from from other people is something quite interesting that

129
00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:53.659
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: could be a typical mistake, a teaching moment for everybody to learn together. Okay, cool. So now let me do this same drill. We have been doing this for almost a year. I'm very happy about regarding the new process. Let me show you.

130
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:59.280
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Let me go to the teaching, Google, Doc. Everyone get access to it. Let me bring it up.

131
00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:05.380
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Did you know teaching us copy paste

132
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:18.790
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and teaching? No?

133
00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:25.160
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, okay, you can. You guys can see my screen right now. Okay, cool. And

134
00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.249
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: all these, all these

135
00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:47.030
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: are literally correct. Answer. If you say, Well, whatever we do in those notes, you pass the interview, I guarantee you. Okay. So all of you guys have access to this my team. Each time we'll finish teaching my team. Let's ready. If we're gonna open AI one.

136
00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:53.560
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: they will copy paste and also turn it into Pdf download

137
00:26:53.720 --> 00:27:18.510
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and put it in your course portal called Kajabi. It's a white label solution. It was a front end. Pmsr, oh, okay, back end is Kajabi. Same thing. It's a login. Okay, once you log in, you will see all the cases and my team copy paste everything there, and also turn the Pdf. For you to download as well. You got everything here. You got access to it as well. So now let me do it. And today, and let me do a link.

138
00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:24.940
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So the error bridge can't access as well.

139
00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.000
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Module 5.

140
00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:55.669
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Today's day is oh, 7, 13th

141
00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.730
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: cool. Let me make it accessible by everybody.

142
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:09.149
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I also need viewer editor.

143
00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:16.900
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Everyone is editor. Let me copy paste. Everyone is editor, print office. Our channel. Everyone has access to this?

144
00:28:24.271 --> 00:28:37.560
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, yeah. Meta could just acquired air travel, air travel is our portfolio company. Yeah. Meta, do you guys see the the crazy drama.

145
00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:42.900
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Meta trying to drama. Okay, it's drama

146
00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:54.259
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: matter trying to pay Openai employee for 100 million dollars in salary was like freaking stupid. But anyway, so so that they don't need to buy a business. They can just

147
00:28:55.130 --> 00:29:05.109
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: move employees to the new company. Crazy stuff! Yes, you can. You can do that as well cool. But anyone keep link here and you can get access to the same

148
00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:11.950
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: thing. Everyone can get access to here. Okay, cool. All right. So now I need 2 tas.

149
00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:16.419
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So you're going to take notes. So last time we teach Openai case.

150
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:20.649
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I think I want to teach this again. It's a it's a fun case. Okay?

151
00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:27.609
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Last November, when we talk open that case, it looks like this. Okay, so

152
00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:32.730
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I need ta, taking notes. All those notes taken by Ta, okay.

153
00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:41.349
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I need 2 tas, and basically, I can focus on teaching. And you guys take notes. I mean taking notes, the purpose of the benefit being a ta is that

154
00:29:41.450 --> 00:30:03.409
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you will remember 90% will teach you one week from now, if you do not take any notes through today's training, you just listen to it. You will forget 90% one week from now. It's science-based data. It's not just me. Okay. So you therefore just need to take notes. So who want to be on ta, why need 2 primary tas? So basically, you write important things I talk about.

155
00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:19.220
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But anyone else can add more things to the sheet. Because this is you guys, I don't edit any of notes. Okay? Then we download copy paste to a course portal and turn the Pdf, anything you want to remind yourself when you read it again is something you need to write.

156
00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:21.496
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, so

157
00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:32.592
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: raise a hand if I want to be my ta, so, but similar to Openai stuff. But we're doing this for for this. Okay, raise a hand who want to be my ta

158
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:37.329
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Now hence let me pick someone.

159
00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.859
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Nasibia nasiba, can you be? Nta.

160
00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:51.670
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Hello.

161
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:53.170
Nassiba Rehan: Hi, yeah.

162
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:54.880
Nassiba Rehan: Hi, there.

163
00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.010
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah. Can you be on ta Nasiba.

164
00:30:58.193 --> 00:31:02.430
Nassiba Rehan: Sorry I missed you. I'm actually in Dubai right now. So I

165
00:31:03.606 --> 00:31:08.590
Nassiba Rehan: no, no, I'm actually in Dubai. It's like 4 am. In the morning.

166
00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.659
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, oh, oh, oh, okay! No!

167
00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:15.989
Nassiba Rehan: I am just trying to stay mute because the family is sleeping. But I didn't want to miss the class.

168
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:19.860
Nassiba Rehan: Okay, great dedication.

169
00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:26.159
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Great dedication. No, I want people to take. I'll be my ta are you able to be my ta

170
00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:27.410
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: take notes.

171
00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:30.468
Nassiba Rehan: I can take notes, but

172
00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:45.619
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But you can speak right? It's okay. It's fine. As long as you stay online as long as stay online the whole time. It's fine. Yeah, why don't you be my ta. So basically, when you write stuff you don't need to speak. I just need to take notes similar to what we did for Openai case.

173
00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:51.699
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But these are real open case questions feel free to watch this. Or you guys can read the notes. If you

174
00:31:54.930 --> 00:32:01.569
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: okay, no problem. Let me pick. Yeah, no problem. Let me let me see. Let me see who can be my ta.

175
00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:03.110
Tung Vu: Dr. Nancy. I can do it.

176
00:32:03.527 --> 00:32:07.290
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Come! Who? Who? Oh, oh, trump! Perfect! Okay.

177
00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:07.890
Tung Vu: Thank you.

178
00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:12.513
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Cool, cool, cool, and pick someone else. I need 2. Ta, just in case I speak too fast.

179
00:32:14.406 --> 00:32:25.169
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Let me see. Who else can you be my ta.

180
00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.020
Ananya Misra: Yeah, sure.

181
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:38.149
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Cool. Okay? So basically, you guys just get here and start typing straightforward copy paste just like open names. Same thing process, then copy paste.

182
00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:42.329
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and then and then almost everything is

183
00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:46.680
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: similar. I'm going to put the Openai thing here

184
00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:51.928
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: so that you can see what the difference is. Very, very straightforward.

185
00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:13.049
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: okay, just so. You know what to look like, but it's just taking notes, very straightforward. Make sure. Let me let me help you add my logo. I think that's important. Part

186
00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:17.850
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: copy on my logo here.

187
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:27.300
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Ow, I messed up stuff.

188
00:33:29.334 --> 00:33:33.180
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: maybe who might know what we're about? How do people my logo, you know.

189
00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:35.314
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I don't know. How does it work.

190
00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:41.393
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: anyway? We'll figure out logo earlier on. So you guys help me out. Okay, with all the logo stuff. Let me

191
00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:49.830
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: holiday to it. Why, I don't even know how to add my own logo, this one.

192
00:33:57.288 --> 00:34:05.420
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Sorry. I mean, you guys figure out, okay, this is blocking stuff. I I'll leave it to you guys.

193
00:34:05.996 --> 00:34:13.300
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, to do too too much, too much disturbance. Okay, so now let me.

194
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:17.749
Mun Chet: Oh, I just put on the header for you. Yeah.

195
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:25.890
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, oh, thank you. So then you can delete whatever. So I'm not going to type anything moving forward. So you guys continue all right? So do this

196
00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:33.734
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: cool, cool, cool. Yeah, same. So let's do this together. Let's solve this case. Oh, at the same time, let me

197
00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:47.200
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Let me make quick comment regarding any important learning we can have based on students pre-submitted questions. So let me am I sharing the right screen? I'm saying.

198
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:50.909
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: be home there, there's some.

199
00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:54.229
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Am I seeing the right discourse.

200
00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:58.439
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: am I.

201
00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:01.310
Mun Chet: You're in the correct one. You just gotta scroll down.

202
00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:04.210
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I have.

203
00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:12.060
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay. So I am on the racing. Okay, cool. Okay. So now, quick

204
00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:22.400
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: feedback based on, let me see any quick learning moment catch a different type of challenge. This is good high level, this is good. Who's who did this? Grace? Good job?

205
00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:27.689
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Let me see, Jenna. By the way, I'm only picking up learning moment.

206
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.850
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: If most are correct. I'm not going to make comment because we want to solve the case together.

207
00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:37.930
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Good!

208
00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.809
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I see most like I could write

209
00:35:46.154 --> 00:35:52.080
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: trump occasional travelers. Is not

210
00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.210
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: a good way to describe traveler.

211
00:35:56.370 --> 00:36:03.440
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: The reason is, if we use frequency to do customer segmentation.

212
00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:08.189
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It doesn't tell the true reason why it is occasional.

213
00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:21.200
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Well, ta, take notes here. Okay, so notes, when when we do customer segmentation is important to do to ask yourself 2 questions, which is

214
00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:23.450
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: why and who

215
00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:39.040
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: right? So let's say, let's use other example. Tourists who are tourists travel. Straightforward! Why? Why they they they travel. Oh, they want to see places straightforward. Right? So now.

216
00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:42.579
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: customer segmentation, who? Occasional traveler?

217
00:36:43.615 --> 00:36:47.139
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Why do occasional travelers travel.

218
00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:59.180
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: There's no straightforward answers, right? Because there are no needs. They they're on budget

219
00:36:59.847 --> 00:37:11.999
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: or places I want to go is usually nearby, so no need to travel far. The many different things not obvious, right? Not obvious. Why? Why occasional traveler need to travel, but Tour is straightforward.

220
00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:20.730
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: They want to go places. They need to travel. They book a flight very fun things to do like straightforward. So we cannot have something like

221
00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:32.719
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: ambiguous when you, when you put the statement of your sub-customer segmentation. So therefore, do not do occasional travelers. Okay, I hope ta took some good notes.

222
00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:41.689
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay. By the way, the way we do it is my ta. If you see one person typing

223
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.280
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: on one thing, you can type the next thing.

224
00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:48.090
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So you guys like, because I speak very fast.

225
00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:55.429
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So maybe he's finishing one statement. You can write the next statement so that we can capture everything. Okay, is this recording very cool

226
00:37:57.238 --> 00:38:11.110
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: as a as a teaching moment, the rest very straightforward. Different service problems, tourist rental cars, all of these the airline. Let me see, since you have. Your

227
00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:17.540
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: agents are good. I think, high level, you guys, you guys get it right?

228
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:25.739
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: High level, you guys get it right? Me do this.

229
00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.760
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, so no, let's let's

230
00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:37.406
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: let me. I might. I'm just I had too many tabs open. Confuse me. Okay, cool. All right.

231
00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:44.019
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: in how people get right. So let's go through the framework very quickly together. Number one thing.

232
00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:54.779
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: let's comprehend situation. This is, say, sign notes. Okay? So we start when when if people ask you the question, design a trial app for Facebook, next part.

233
00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.680
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: comprehensive situation.

234
00:38:57.010 --> 00:39:01.519
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: When you comprehend situation as I mentioned, mainly focus on 2 things.

235
00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:10.789
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: actually 3 things in China. Number one. Mention of company number 2. Current situation. Inflation, like all these things, are expensive, all post-covid.

236
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:14.430
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I think. Post Covid triggered. The growth of travel?

237
00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:20.840
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And then the 3rd thing, you can talk about

238
00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:27.240
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: examples of challenges that why, you think

239
00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:34.900
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: we need to still to design a travel app today, what's missing?

240
00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:38.388
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay? So let me

241
00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:48.800
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: let me give you a specific example. What would I say during the interview? Ta, take notes. I'm going to say, really fast.

242
00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:52.280
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: If you ask me the question, I'll be like

243
00:39:52.590 --> 00:40:01.169
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: great question. By the way, it doesn't matter. Interview, question the central platform for Facebook. They asked this question before. Okay? And

244
00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:09.999
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: he's asking me a question. I said, Oh, great! Thank you for the question. Let me let me see through this. 1st of all.

245
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:18.269
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: let me understand. The mission of Meta, based on my understanding, is is to create a using tools to create a community together

246
00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:21.500
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: so that people are getting closer.

247
00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:23.150
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And

248
00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:43.689
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: in the current situation I can see there's lots of demand of travel, because we just had, like 3 years lockdown of Covid. And now nowadays the 3rd surge demand of travel. At the same time, we're also going through very interesting stage of the economy. We're also experiencing inflation.

249
00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:55.130
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So which also means that currently the travelers are still facing a lot of like challenges, for example, could be

250
00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:57.490
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: the

251
00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:30.573
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: higher demand and also of traveling. However, misorganization in terms of travel schedule. We have been hearing more and more like flight accidents. I see you guys know what I'm talking about. More and more flight, accident or flight delay, and, like fly impacted by other things that leading to like

252
00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:37.090
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: unhappy experience for travel and the travel industry is also going through lots of stress.

253
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:48.479
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: They try to serve the customer well, but lots of things out of their control, such as higher demand or engine issue, logistic issue that leading to a lot of like

254
00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:55.879
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: delay of flight and challenges. This is just one thing. There's also lots of changes in terms of

255
00:41:56.270 --> 00:42:26.020
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: the travel and everything, and hotels become more and more expensive. People also trying to figure out what's the best way. They're still able to travel and enjoy their time in the new destination as well. So therefore, I do see there is a great need for us to revisit, to look into what we can do to create a better like a travel app experience. And today for Facebook users

256
00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:29.130
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and them after you said that.

257
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:46.099
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you also say something in terms of now, here is my assumption, I assume, given what I said earlier, I assume. Oh, by the way, I also want to say so, therefore, and also creating a travel app is also meeting the mission of Facebook

258
00:42:46.120 --> 00:43:15.060
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: that we're able to create, connecting people with different locations and help them get closer through culture and people. Experience of creating a better community throughout the entire world in terms of travel, culture, and definitely in alignment with the mission of the company. As we continue to solve the case. I do have several assumptions, and number one, I assume the goal of

259
00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:27.709
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: us creating this app is mainly focused on the best customer experience. Designing travel app. The main mission is not to optimize the revenue.

260
00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:35.699
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: for now, of course, we're always trying to generate as much revenue as possible, but when we design this, we want to focus on creating the best

261
00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:40.679
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: experience for the travel app is this assumption? Okay.

262
00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.919
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I'm going to ask the interviewer.

263
00:43:45.260 --> 00:44:08.680
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Right? And then I'm also going to say the next thing if the interview might. Yeah, it's okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're not focusing on optimizing revenue. Right now, we just want to create the best travel app to serve our customers at this moment. Okay, good to know as example. And then I will say, well, with with all those assumptions, my understanding of the case right now. Is there anything I missed

264
00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:13.519
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and ask, interface anything I missed?

265
00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:20.699
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Always stay your assumptions, and and as

266
00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:25.949
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: as much as you want, and then always ask, Is there anything I missed?

267
00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:29.019
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: The interviewer? This is very critical.

268
00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:35.430
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, why, we lay out these kind of conversation

269
00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:38.870
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: in the interview. Is this number one?

270
00:44:41.680 --> 00:45:11.630
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: They want to hear you talking about mission of the company. This is, I guess I just know I have student, many students working for Meta right now. They are going through the same experience they love to hear. Oh, you were for Meta, all of these. They love you, hearing people talking about Meta's mission straightforward, and then also connecting with the current economy all of these, and then connect back the mission. Okay, so straightforward. And then I also why I also put assumptions in terms of.

271
00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:21.489
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: we're mainly focused on creating the best travel app experience for product, not just optimizing the revenue as one of the like main goal. The reason is.

272
00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:28.130
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: if you optimize revenue, the way you design it will be different.

273
00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:42.430
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, or at least at this moment, when we design this, want to create the best product. For now we'll talk about revenue later, instead of our number one priority is to optimize revenue as much as possible.

274
00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:52.929
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: that that will lead the design and then lead to different prioritization. If an optimize revenue, probably you want to go for someone who can pay you right away. As example

275
00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:57.209
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: is that average people who want to save money on travel as example.

276
00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:01.290
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Right? So the the intent.

277
00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:16.750
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Austain. Those assumptions ahead of time is very critical. So therefore, the goal is to create the best travel app experience, not just optimize revenue, so to say, make it very clear upfront, because it's going to

278
00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:28.869
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: put you on very different track in terms of customers, customer prioritization and solution and everything. If you focus on revenue is very different from best experience. Okay? And then, especially in big tech company nowadays.

279
00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:35.929
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: The entire strategy is, you know, you know, Meta's business model sell ads

280
00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:42.070
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: as team's goal is to make as much money as possible.

281
00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:44.690
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Straightforward, however.

282
00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:55.659
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: all other Pm's in Meta is trying to increase people's experience and have high, like.

283
00:46:55.840 --> 00:47:02.979
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: like daily active users, and also have high like, how to describe what Youtube watch time, Facebook probably have, like

284
00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:09.569
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: app time, how much time people spend on the app, the more time, the better. So they have better experience. Get you hooked?

285
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:18.750
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Right? So so if you're hired, let's say Facebook does have a travel app, right? If you hire a travel, app prompt manager, you go is, get people hooked

286
00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:21.850
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and then your ads team start turning on ads.

287
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:28.219
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay? So therefore, we like to clarify upfront.

288
00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:37.629
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, cool. So that will say, to comprehend situation, upfront and then feel free to ask any other scoping claim question.

289
00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:41.389
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: For example, you can ask, oh, it is like.

290
00:47:42.967 --> 00:47:45.750
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: any kind of pressure. I don't even know.

291
00:47:46.470 --> 00:48:08.109
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It is for global market Us. Market. You can. You can ask anything moving forward from now on any kind of assumptions you guys have. Okay, let me let me do this. Let me take. I'm going to take Jenna's questions later, but I want people to ask me any questions. Clarifying questions you have in your mind. Assuming I'm the interviewer. What question do you have

292
00:48:08.723 --> 00:48:19.380
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: to clarify your mind? So that we can move on to design the app, well, identify customers and pain point design the app. Okay, any other clarifying questions you guys have for me.

293
00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:20.530
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: for interviewer.

294
00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:23.060
Tung Vu: Oh.

295
00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:32.639
Tung Vu: I don't know how to raise hands here, for some reason there's no ui, but I was trying to get I would probably ask, is it is this the integrated?

296
00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:37.989
Tung Vu: If if the travel app is integrated as part of the Facebook app, or it's a separate

297
00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:39.629
Tung Vu: entirely app.

298
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:52.939
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Good question. You can ask this question in the interview as long as anything scoping question can ask. Okay, just don't ask them to design it for you. If I were the interviewer. If I'm the interviewer, I'm going to respond, saying that

299
00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:54.650
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: it's up to you.

300
00:48:55.650 --> 00:49:07.200
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you can make a standalone app or you make it integrated within Facebook. I leave it to you. Whatever is the best to achieve our goal, we should create the best travel

301
00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:10.890
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: experience. I leave it to you. You can decide.

302
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:18.149
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, interview. Feel free to ask the question. Interviewer will respond this way, but at least I will respond this way.

303
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:28.090
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: More likely interview is going to give you very open-ended directions. Oh, after you, whatever can hit the goal, best experience, whatever you want to do.

304
00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:35.179
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: okay, and just get it. More likely they're going to tell you whatever you want to do. But it is is a very legit question to ask.

305
00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:41.889
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Cool anyone, have any claim question. Clear, refined questions want to ask me.

306
00:49:43.836 --> 00:50:11.299
Jana Jiang: I. I have 2 questions. One of the question is about clarification questions. One of my clarification question is that when I say this case, I kind of feel like the biggest strength of Mita. To developing the travel app is to actually create helping helping people to find the travel mates like travel, Buddy, because they already have so many users, and they already have so many services.

307
00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:16.710
Jana Jiang: And instead of just launching a travel app like just

308
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:42.769
Jana Jiang: like expedia and all other app on the market. Already. The biggest strength is that they could have. People organize their own group on the, on the on the page, on the product, helping people find mates. That's something other platform doesn't have. And Meta can leverage their specialty. So so my clarification would be probably about the competition, about the scoping that

309
00:50:43.304 --> 00:50:52.390
Jana Jiang: do you see? This app is more for people to find travel body, or it's

310
00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:56.539
Jana Jiang: it's more pro providing services. I'm not sure if this is a good.

311
00:50:56.847 --> 00:50:58.999
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Wrong question to ask. Ta take notes

312
00:51:00.788 --> 00:51:05.840
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: The reason this is a wrong question to ask is that

313
00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:10.030
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: this is based on the pain point of customers. Right.

314
00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:11.450
Jana Jiang: Hmm.

315
00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:14.929
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And also based on prioritization on Pain Point.

316
00:51:17.213 --> 00:51:23.380
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So therefore you shouldn't even ask, and I wouldn't even answer. Leave it to you.

317
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:43.600
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: whatever the goal is assumption. We said earlier and best travel app experience in Korea for people. That's it. Right? Yes, so wrong question to ask, even if you ask? I won't tell you. I'd rather not to ask, because you're asking the interview to solve case for you.

318
00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:47.310
Jana Jiang: Got it.

319
00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:52.679
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, what other question you have Jenna camera on, if possible. Anyone, if possible. Camera. Okay.

320
00:51:52.680 --> 00:52:17.869
Jana Jiang: Yeah, another question, is it just high level on the on the mission? You're talking about that? You're mentioning that Facebook like to hear people talking about their mission. So I'm just wondering in other cases that in the Facebook interview they want you to be Pm. For Microsoft and want you to Pm. To zoom. So in that case, should we also talk about the mission because

321
00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:24.695
Jana Jiang: they could be random company, and you don't have all the mission by your hand to just talk about the mission.

322
00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:25.780
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Cool question.

323
00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:27.696
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay? So

324
00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:39.810
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: yes, if they, if they were the design open table. This, I think the information open table something. By the way all these questions are in module 2

325
00:52:39.810 --> 00:53:00.089
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: module to resources. They say, all of the everybody. If you're new, you should learn how to do it, find those resources. By the way, the best way to do it is, do a search. We turn on search, bar this new feature for Kajabi, for a white label solution. Back in Kajabi search bar. You can just put interview questions, database as example. You can find it. Okay, straightforward. But the thing is

326
00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:06.790
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: what I would focus on

327
00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:11.230
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: the

328
00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:24.910
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: different type of Company's mission. Not just matters, mission. Let's say they will ask you a question. You will. You will see there was an open table design, something for opentable design, something for zoom design, something for all of the economy. Talk about those companies, Mission.

329
00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:29.199
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: not Manor's mission. So now here comes the challenge. What if open tables?

330
00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:37.820
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And I personally never use opentable. But we are all super user of zoom. Right? So let's say opentable. Never use it before

331
00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:40.089
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you try your best, you guess.

332
00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:52.829
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, Nancy, design a better experience for a open table type, app helping people to book rooms or tables on the in restaurants.

333
00:53:53.120 --> 00:54:00.940
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I'll say, hmm, I assume the mission of opentable is, let me guess. Okay.

334
00:54:05.370 --> 00:54:19.510
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: the mission opentable is creating the most enjoyable restaurants experience for people to enjoy

335
00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:34.190
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: their meals by finding the right spot for them and also removing restaurants, headache of operations

336
00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:35.870
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: in terms of reservation.

337
00:54:38.350 --> 00:54:39.890
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: This is my assumption

338
00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:58.930
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: with that in mind, why we need to redesign open table. Nowadays, when nowadays post covid inflation, going up, going eating a restaurant so expensive. I will start going. Okay. But I will say, the mission is this, and then here's

339
00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:09.619
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: assumption, this is a mission, and then we'll go through the same framework we'll link link back to the mission is enjoy a better experience for restaurants, and also reduce restaurants operations

340
00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:30.089
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: which which why would design this case can help them to achieve the mission. You try your best, even if you don't know the mission of the company. So now let me see if I guess it correctly when you search right now altogether, but at the same time try your best, using your assumption. If you see of the company, what do you think? Say something nice? Right?

341
00:55:30.610 --> 00:55:36.180
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Facebook, make people feel good on social media and wrong. Don't say it right.

342
00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:37.170
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: No

343
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:45.290
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: closer together. Okay, cool. Sounds better. So say something more positive using assumptions. But you do need to say something.

344
00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:48.430
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: because if you don't say it.

345
00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:53.979
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: the the bigger direction is off.

346
00:55:54.890 --> 00:55:59.730
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Last time, when you prioritize customers, a lot of everything, all the framework will do later. Today

347
00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:08.050
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you will realize that. Oh, you can use mission as a way to argue, this is

348
00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:16.489
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: the right direction or not for selecting right customer segmentation, customer, pain. Point all of this. So you do need to say something up front

349
00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:20.240
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: at the High Level guideline.

350
00:56:20.570 --> 00:56:25.920
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Right? So let me let me see if I guess it correctly. Open table Mission. I think they will say things nicer than what I said.

351
00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:29.240
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Open Table Mission. Let's see what the hell

352
00:56:30.310 --> 00:56:39.659
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: leading program for free real-time online reservation. This is about us. What's the Mission Open Table Mission.

353
00:56:41.490 --> 00:56:42.650
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Why does it?

354
00:56:42.930 --> 00:56:45.310
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Why, why, AI doesn't give me a

355
00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:50.260
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: omission, why, why, Gemini doesn't give me some reference.

356
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:54.920
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: We we love what can happen around restaurant table.

357
00:56:58.630 --> 00:57:02.239
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Interesting. We love what can happen around the restaurant table?

358
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:03.510
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay?

359
00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:06.660
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Interesting.

360
00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:14.200
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So weird. But anyway. So if you know this, you can say we love. What can happen around restaurant table?

361
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:21.960
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You can also say the plain version, what I described. But open table is this, a lot can happen around the restaurant table.

362
00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:23.070
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay.

363
00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:29.209
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But if I notice, I also elaborate, we love what can happen around rest and table means

364
00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:38.869
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: more enjoyable experience, less headache for restaurants. I was still going to elaborate. Okay, but try your best. Try your best.

365
00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:41.609
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, but but just try your best zoom

366
00:57:43.370 --> 00:57:50.200
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: like best communication tools ever. If it's a mission. Probably, let's say Zoom's mission, I mean, out of curiosity.

367
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:58.040
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: create the best communication tools connecting world together, frictionless. Now.

368
00:57:58.210 --> 00:58:02.029
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: video communication frequency similar to what I guessed.

369
00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:10.979
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Best communication tool video communication, frictionless. Sounds really cool. High level. Okay, try your best. Okay, cool any other questions or clarifying questions you want to ask me?

370
00:58:11.310 --> 00:58:15.840
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: No, no, for this case. Cool, cool, cool, great. So keep going. Keep going.

371
00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:26.270
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Customer segmentation. Hello, ta! It did. Good job taking all the notes. Important. Good question. Anyone.

372
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:28.430
Vishal Bhoir: Yeah. Dr. Nancy, can you hear me?

373
00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:31.300
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, yeah, we shall go ahead. Camera on, if possible.

374
00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:33.300
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: When is your Meta interview?

375
00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:39.680
Vishal Bhoir: I had 3 weeks back it didn't went well.

376
00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:40.800
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Hmm.

377
00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:47.833
Vishal Bhoir: Yep. So there were 2 case. The analytics case was a design

378
00:58:48.730 --> 00:58:54.449
Vishal Bhoir: no, not design. But what do you think about the notification feature for Facebook.

379
00:58:55.870 --> 00:59:04.029
Vishal Bhoir: That's the analytical question and for design question. It was like design, a Google parking feature for Google Map.

380
00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:07.589
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: We have, we talked about that case parking?

381
00:59:07.590 --> 00:59:11.120
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, I I actually, you know, no one.

382
00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:21.549
Vishal Bhoir: I actually went through point and point, as you thought, in the lecture, and I don't know they didn't give the explanation. Why, it was not.

383
00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:24.070
Vishal Bhoir: Yeah rotation.

384
00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:28.870
Vishal Bhoir: But I know exactly how you got. Yeah, each and every one.

385
00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:39.450
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: If they ask you, what do you think? The notification features of Facebook or Instagram? Facebook.

386
00:59:41.225 --> 00:59:41.730
Vishal Bhoir: Facebook.

387
00:59:41.730 --> 00:59:50.270
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay notification of Facebook. And then you should go through. What do you think? The mission, the North Star Metrics of

388
00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:59.730
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: notification? And how is the notification features is serving the purpose of the North Side metrics and same thing as the yeah.

389
01:00:01.330 --> 01:00:07.889
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and also the mission of Facebook as a whole, which is longer time spending on the app something like that.

390
01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:13.909
Vishal Bhoir: Yeah, I, timing session officers can walk you through.

391
01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:14.820
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Hmm.

392
01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:30.369
Vishal Bhoir: I was just wondering, like, you know, you're you're taking a different feature or different app for Meta or Google, Youtube, like, right? If one day you can take Facebook as an app

393
01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:44.040
Vishal Bhoir: and adding a feature as a case, right? That will give a high level of the company. For example, Facebook for Google, for I mean Youtube for Google like that.

394
01:00:44.687 --> 01:00:50.889
Vishal Bhoir: It will. Helpful, you know, because they they have been asking this kind of question.

395
01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:57.059
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I don't understand. Your question is, or your statement. Are you saying that we do a case about Facebook app.

396
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:59.470
Vishal Bhoir: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

397
01:00:59.730 --> 01:01:01.479
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: How to improve Facebook. App.

398
01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:08.610
Vishal Bhoir: Yeah. So like, if you are a Pm for a notification feature for Facebook, what do you do?

399
01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:10.139
Vishal Bhoir: I like those?

400
01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:14.260
Vishal Bhoir: Because they have been asking those kind of questions a lot.

401
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:15.770
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay.

402
01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:18.110
Vishal Bhoir: Okay. And regarding this.

403
01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:20.710
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Take notes, take notes next next case.

404
01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:26.239
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: if you are the Noti, if you are the Pm. For notification of Facebook, what would you do.

405
01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:29.100
Vishal Bhoir: Analytical, Analytical.

406
01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.989
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Is this, what would you do

407
01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:36.640
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: not design? The question is, what would you do.

408
01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:48.940
Vishal Bhoir: No, no, this is like analytical question. So you are a Pm. For notification. Bell icon in Facebook. How do you improve.

409
01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:53.580
Vishal Bhoir: or what do you do for it's an analytical question.

410
01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:58.170
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, yeah, we can do this case.

411
01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:17.529
Vishal Bhoir: Yeah, next time. Yeah. So so regarding today's case, my question was, when when we have to comprehend right, the 3 elements which we have to focus is the mission. The second is the current situation, and 3rd is the missing part. Right? So the missing part is basically you have to analyze what

412
01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:26.869
Vishal Bhoir: is there in the market for travel app, and how you will be building the travel app for Meta. Right? So you have to do the comparison. Swag analysis.

413
01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:27.870
Vishal Bhoir: So.

414
01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:31.420
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Not not in that extent. That's a high level.

415
01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:32.030
Vishal Bhoir: Okay.

416
01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:39.790
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: The the this session comprehensive situation in high level. What do you think is is missing? Not not like competitive analysis.

417
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:41.720
Vishal Bhoir: Okay, so do you think.

418
01:02:45.590 --> 01:02:46.660
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Hello! You cut off.

419
01:02:51.790 --> 01:02:53.089
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Michelle, you cut off.

420
01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:58.840
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: We shall cut off. Hello!

421
01:03:00.930 --> 01:03:01.900
Vishal Bhoir: Going on.

422
01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:04.970
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, you're back. You're back. Oh, what is it? What do you say?

423
01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:14.809
Vishal Bhoir: Yeah. So I was saying, like, do you think, is it a good idea to give them a overview? Why Meta should develop a travel app? Why? Why question.

424
01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:19.179
Vishal Bhoir: or should should Meta develop a travel app.

425
01:03:21.210 --> 01:03:25.749
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You can add it from. You can add it back to the comprehensive situation here.

426
01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:27.230
Vishal Bhoir: Okay.

427
01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:35.789
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, you can add it back here. All right. So we have seen a trend. So you should open the case this way for sure.

428
01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:38.650
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, can you take notes?

429
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:45.239
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: We also have seen a trend in terms of interviewer, might ask you question in terms of why do you think

430
01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:48.750
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Meta should develop a travel app.

431
01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:54.460
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: They may ask you a question like that. Here, take notes under right? Right above. I question

432
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:59.000
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you always open the case the way we did it

433
01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:10.470
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: always. Okay, because this covers different, the flow is correct, and also within 2 min you open the case and ask all different clinical questions plus assumptions. Now

434
01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:18.309
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: they might ask the question, why do you think Meta should have a travel app as example?

435
01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:25.230
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Right? So if they ask you this question you should use the Gucci framework.

436
01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:36.040
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And yeah, you should use the Gucci framework up front with within like 3 min.

437
01:04:36.730 --> 01:04:39.650
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Because this is a design interview.

438
01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:43.489
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Gucci framework itself is a 45 min interview question.

439
01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:48.329
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But given, this is a product design interview, not a product strategy interview.

440
01:04:49.530 --> 01:04:54.920
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You need to use Gucci framework, but say it short and concise

441
01:04:55.810 --> 01:05:05.220
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: instead of do a full 45 min, the 45 min you go to Module 8. What you can. You can see the blow up version of 45 min interview right? So now, given a design interview.

442
01:05:05.470 --> 01:05:10.989
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: If if they ask you, why would Meta develop the the the travel app!

443
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:13.880
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You start with the same thing.

444
01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:24.220
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Ghost Mission Company. I matter. Bring like closer together, right? And then customer segmentation on my needs, and then hype, but adhere.

445
01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:30.440
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I will leave customer segmentation in the I session framework

446
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:41.989
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I will just describe in terms of well, there's so many different people doing like travel right now. They're the leisure travel, the business travel different kind of travelers.

447
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.510
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: high level. But I will immediately jump into different kind of like unmet needs right now.

448
01:05:48.890 --> 01:06:12.730
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: which is the same thing as opening simulator here, which is right now, we can see in a high level. There are lots of inflation. People want to travel, and lots of like operation of airplanes are getting worse and worse nowadays, at least in my fewer data set. Okay, you know the airplane job nowadays from the sky. And there's a lot of travel delay

449
01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:15.390
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: for the for the flight

450
01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:21.730
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I've experienced. Okay, not everybody. I maybe they're always travel delay. Okay, but but for my

451
01:06:22.690 --> 01:06:36.150
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: my flights, my friend's flights, I heard those travel delay a lot as example. Right? So those are the high level on my needs right now and then. You talk about competition

452
01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:43.120
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: now. The the clearly! There are huge amenities. And out there lots of lots of problem to be solved.

453
01:06:43.250 --> 01:07:08.029
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And you also make it clear later session. In the case, I'm going to do a deep dive regarding different kind of amenities here now, just in a high level regarding what the typical type of Amenis I can think of, and that can link back to. Why clearly the huge Amenis huge gap in the travel industry right now. Even it has kind of it's mature for a while, but a huge problem nowadays.

454
01:07:08.170 --> 01:07:13.409
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And then regarding competition in the space. Right now.

455
01:07:14.590 --> 01:07:20.910
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you need to mention specifically what are the high level competition you know about

456
01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:27.619
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: right? And now the in the competition space with. Why, Meta, look into the space you can talk about. Well, nowadays

457
01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:35.149
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you can think about what matters goal is creating better communities.

458
01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:44.480
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Currently, we already have our strengths in terms of like customer data.

459
01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:50.039
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And our competitor, our Meta's true competitor, is actually like Google, who run ads

460
01:07:50.890 --> 01:08:04.380
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: these kind of like a fan companies and also competing with Tiktok. That's our own competition, plus. There's other people who say, like expedia.com. All those kind of existing airline companies. Right now

461
01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:12.799
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: these are our competition. And also Meta is also competing with all the AI companies.

462
01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:17.809
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: because we have our like open source AI model.

463
01:08:17.970 --> 01:08:24.790
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and which also lead to like competing with Openai, all those high level, like AI companies.

464
01:08:24.970 --> 01:08:29.300
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Now, with all those information together.

465
01:08:29.850 --> 01:08:40.730
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: by the way, the we, and then we also have our own strengths, which is we. We actually have data which integrate ecosystem, which is our strengths. Go to. I,

466
01:08:41.164 --> 01:08:50.289
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: in. We have data for all our like users. Right now, people use Instagram if even if most people don't use Facebook in the Us. But people still use Instagram.

467
01:08:50.390 --> 01:09:02.930
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: All right. We have all the all, the all the data from our customers, all the usage, and we have our own large language model. And so, therefore, so creating. That's your conclusion.

468
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:10.200
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: creating the the leveraging, creating like a travel app. On one hand.

469
01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:17.040
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: we're able to solve real, urgent needs, urgent unmet needs in the travel industry.

470
01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:26.890
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: On the other hand, we also are going to increase the engagement and the stickiness of people using Facebook

471
01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:33.649
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: app given currency. Not at least in the Us. Lots of people do not use Facebook

472
01:09:34.266 --> 01:09:43.350
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: as much as before. So it's another way for us to drive bigger and better user engagement for the app that has been declining for a while.

473
01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:58.300
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: On the other hand, as we can see the rise of AI, and actually the like AI travel agent, all those kind of like AI type of related features has been like

474
01:09:59.110 --> 01:10:03.049
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: widely talked about

475
01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:14.310
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and easier to develop in terms of AI travel agent nowadays. So this is almost like lower hanging fruit for us to quickly gain users

476
01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:15.959
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: for our app.

477
01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:36.089
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And once I have even more users, we can maybe continuously leveraging their data to even train our AI model and have more and more people leveraging and using our AI product. So therefore, this specific product is leveraging a strategic initiative where Meta as a company can tap, into

478
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:42.729
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: which in summary is AI, and also all the like social engagement

479
01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:46.639
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and gaining data after user for

480
01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:49.870
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Facebook, which is the declining app.

481
01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:52.820
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So this is something. What would I say in the interview?

482
01:10:55.860 --> 01:11:00.890
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, so basically, you understand what what just happened? You run the Gucci variable quickly.

483
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:06.910
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Then you give them your rationale. Why, we need to create the travel app for Facebook.

484
01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:23.260
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: The power cushion framework is, give you the the source to create a strategy. Fast wishes I describe here.

485
01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:28.410
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Does it make sense to everybody straightforward?

486
01:11:28.690 --> 01:11:48.909
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You see the power of Gucci one. By the way, Gucci burn is module A. All my senior Pm. Need to go to module a 1st learning about the Gucci framework. If you're new, this is the 1st time exposing you to Gucci Framework, you can go to Module a first.st This is just as I mentioned nowadays, the interviews we have seen in 45 min, and they ask you to use somehow. They want you to use 3 frameworks.

487
01:11:51.250 --> 01:11:57.919
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, if they ask you why this question upfront is Gucci framework plus modified service framework.

488
01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:04.520
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But you I want to understand. It's very fast. See how fast I just run through the framework quickly.

489
01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:12.139
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and then go back to answer the question. You shouldn't directly just answer question. Why do you think Meta should have trouble? App?

490
01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:16.200
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You guys probably will go to Jenna's track, which is.

491
01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:25.650
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: oh, other people are just booking apps. We have social media. So we can drive more user engagement. And if you go for that route, you forgot. AI,

492
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:29.270
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: right? So if you run the Gucci framework.

493
01:12:30.270 --> 01:12:32.269
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It will give you the answer

494
01:12:33.310 --> 01:12:35.349
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: it would take. Oh, what what would you compete?

495
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:40.319
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: We compete for? AI. We compete for social media. 2 things will compete

496
01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:43.940
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: social media declining for Facebook. I'm sorry it's true.

497
01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:45.310
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: A. I.

498
01:12:46.190 --> 01:12:48.530
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And we're not on number one.

499
01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:53.179
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Clearly. Well, we're kind of in the middle, you know, coming in. But we have users.

500
01:12:54.640 --> 01:13:01.610
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, we have users. We have. Okay. AI, hey, AI, we have decline. Yeah, 3 things.

501
01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:07.919
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: What do we do? Why, we do travel. Ha, ha! Connecting all the 3 things.

502
01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:13.739
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and we have unmet needs for travel. And then the 3 things we do in the company travel app can hit all 3.

503
01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:19.130
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Make sense to you guys, and you link them so well together.

504
01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:30.400
Vishal Bhoir: Dr. Nancy, if they ask like why don't we build e-commerce platform for Meta rather than travel app.

505
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:52.219
Vishal Bhoir: Because if you see the unmet need of the market situation. People are more tend to use the e-commerce platform right? Rather than travel app. So do we need to go go deep into the statistics of you know how many actually needs travel apps than the e-commerce.

506
01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:53.170
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: No.

507
01:13:54.698 --> 01:13:56.840
Vishal Bhoir: Because you are.

508
01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:58.769
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Digging a hole for yourself.

509
01:13:59.180 --> 01:13:59.970
Vishal Bhoir: Okay.

510
01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:04.580
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Right today to talk about travel, app you only about the travel travel app.

511
01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:13.040
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You don't need to sell the so the number of travel people. Number of people using travel app is smaller than the number of people doing e-commerce, which is kind of true.

512
01:14:13.930 --> 01:14:17.009
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So therefore, we need to go for e-commerce kind of weird

513
01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:23.799
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: right? So so I would stick to travel app without raising the numbers of

514
01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:27.890
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: other things will have higher volume than travel. App.

515
01:14:29.592 --> 01:14:37.359
Vishal Bhoir: because because you saw the strategy. Tiktok use right, so they first, st target the social media platform tiktok.

516
01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:37.920
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay.

517
01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:44.349
Vishal Bhoir: And then they smoothly move to the e-commerce to compete with Amazon. Right? That's their strategy.

518
01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:53.660
Vishal Bhoir: And if you see their target for this year. Next year. Right? They wants to become more on the top rank.

519
01:14:53.910 --> 01:15:04.589
Vishal Bhoir: Then Amazon. That's their target for this year. So if Meta follows the same thing because they used to

520
01:15:04.590 --> 01:15:06.299
Vishal Bhoir: Mera. Did they failed?

521
01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:07.450
Vishal Bhoir: Default? Okay.

522
01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:17.999
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: We talk about the the same case Tiktok shopping last week Meta had the same strategy. They failed. They Meta have Meta shopping something. Yeah, they have meta shopping

523
01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:26.330
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: before I tried to register, and myself. They reject me as a as a whatever store owner.

524
01:15:27.616 --> 01:15:33.030
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Over there, so metashopping itself. When they try to do it, they failed.

525
01:15:33.850 --> 01:15:37.480
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, it's not. They don't have the strategy. They're failing execution.

526
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:39.610
Vishal Bhoir: Okay.

527
01:15:39.610 --> 01:15:47.670
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: They failed already. I just watched last week's case when I talk about Tiktok shopping where I link back to metashopping

528
01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:51.380
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: that fell big time in square shopping. Sorry not management in square shopping.

529
01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:55.199
Vishal Bhoir: The very big time. Okay, cool. So therefore, we're going to any case.

530
01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:56.810
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Stick to this.

531
01:15:57.030 --> 01:16:01.740
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Do not dig a hole for yourself to jump into something else. You're not prepared.

532
01:16:02.910 --> 01:16:07.100
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay? Okay. Okay. Do not take a hold. Just stick to this. You will pass. Interview.

533
01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:08.025
Vishal Bhoir: Okay,

534
01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:11.239
Vishal Bhoir: And Nancy last week there was no class right?

535
01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:15.830
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: No? Oh, I mean last time, when Teach would say, module, 4, module, 4.

536
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:16.640
Vishal Bhoir: Okay. Okay.

537
01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:19.049
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Module. Go to Module 4 Tiktok shopping.

538
01:16:19.570 --> 01:16:20.300
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Hmm.

539
01:16:23.176 --> 01:16:37.673
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: keep going. Okay, speed speed. Everybody speed. Keep going. Customer segmentation. Okay, okay, cool. Cool. So now let's quickly do customer segmentation very straightforward. You guys have a lot lots of correct answers. Actually,

540
01:16:39.410 --> 01:16:43.650
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: many of you guys get get ring, get it right?

541
01:16:44.650 --> 01:16:48.580
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: traveler, business traveler, legal travel, niche, traveler, straightforward.

542
01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:55.730
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: all right. So copy paste. And this is, let's just save time.

543
01:16:55.950 --> 01:17:15.009
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: This is right. Answer for right answer, ta, you copy paste, because each time we do things I messed up your format. This is a great answer. Okay, so sorry. Before we do this. Let's do highest customer segmentation before we do. Sub customer segmentation very straightforward. So it's travel two-sided marketplace, highest level

544
01:17:15.690 --> 01:17:20.840
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: travelers, travelers, straightforward service providers

545
01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:29.119
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: when you travel. You and me travel for many different reasons for business, for fun, for many different things, anything you can imagine. Travel.

546
01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:35.509
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: We travel. We are travelers, but they are service providers.

547
01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:50.910
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: very straightforward, right service provider could improve many things, restaurants, airplane company travel, agency, public transportation. It can work like many different things, but in the highest level travelers, service providers.

548
01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:55.330
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay? Then you can do something called 3rd party.

549
01:17:57.290 --> 01:18:02.700
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: All the 3rd parties, everything else, the two-sided marketplace where everything else. Go to 3rd parties.

550
01:18:03.410 --> 01:18:25.680
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: All right, high level. Have this. But I have more things. I want to add to what she had. All right, 1st of all for travelers as in for travelers, subcustomer segmentation for travelers. It's fine. I think she got it right on people copy taking. Yeah. Great, cool, cool. Yeah, exactly cool. Yes, high level. She got it right. Businesses, leisure and niche.

551
01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:35.930
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, so niche, including up with kids disabilities. It's something special, you know, all these like

552
01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:37.749
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: leisure for fun.

553
01:18:38.170 --> 01:18:44.219
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I think lots of us is that we have a vacation coming out usually. For this reason you and me travel right

554
01:18:44.914 --> 01:18:46.929
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and then for businesses.

555
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:59.780
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: straightforward, you guys know. Okay for fun, for businesses or a little bit niche, something like unique special with kids or disability. Sometimes for medical reasons.

556
01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:02.570
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and it uses like

557
01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:20.940
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: injured. You need to see a doctors. Many other reasons. Okay, basically, all those niche special things. But usually people travel for 2 main reasons, right? So sub customers, segmentation is here right cool. So therefore, back to what Trump said trunk. Originally you said occasional travel. Okay.

558
01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:29.920
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: tourist, I seem straightforward equals to for leisure tourist leisure. I think the same category, right? Business travel. You get right now. Occasional occasional travelers.

559
01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:32.720
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Do you mean? I think now.

560
01:19:33.670 --> 01:19:38.799
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: your occasional problem could be, people travel for fun is also occasional. Make sense to you guys.

561
01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:49.240
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Right? So so so therefore we don't segment it just for frequency only if the frequency represent

562
01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:59.909
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: the reason right? So right now, what you had, occasional traveler doesn't represent the reason, but we prefer to make it like leisure.

563
01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:14.700
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Usual leisure is, say, once, twice per year, travel like for fun, like something like that. Right? So so that's the reason we do it this way. And now we do service providers among question.

564
01:20:16.725 --> 01:20:28.700
Mun Chet: Yes, sorry. I don't have a quick question. Sorry this already gone over. For the customer segmentations. Is it always recommended to go like to list as many as you can, or just like 3 typically.

565
01:20:29.110 --> 01:20:35.610
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: 3 is going to number in the interview. So now to study marketplace, a quick question. Take notes

566
01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:39.210
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: to set a marketplace 2 sides.

567
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:54.780
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You're not required to have 3. But if you want to have 3, no problem, you can add, like 3rd parties, the the easiest one is, add 3rd parties as example. If, if it's beyond this 2, you can add 3rd party

568
01:20:56.180 --> 01:21:09.314
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: easy, but but usually 2 sided marketplace is 2 sides. No problem. If a 3rd side, no problem. You have more side marketplace, no problem, but it's based on reality, right? But for sub-customer segmentation.

569
01:21:10.770 --> 01:21:13.889
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: usually 3 in general.

570
01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:16.120
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: 3 Guru number in the interview.

571
01:21:19.710 --> 01:21:26.850
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: If you have 4, no problem, if it's 5, not that bad.

572
01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:37.433
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: If I'm more than 5, you need to ask yourself, did I?

573
01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:42.130
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: use the best way to do sub-customer segmentation?

574
01:21:45.190 --> 01:21:47.690
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay for the perfect passing interview?

575
01:21:49.730 --> 01:21:52.410
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, it just yeah.

576
01:21:53.410 --> 01:21:59.589
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Because there's several smart foods. I mean, you can get like you can make disabilities, you can add.

577
01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:03.890
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I don't know different trouble. So it's a smaller. Add the smaller things right?

578
01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:08.469
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And then maybe maybe all these 3 already group them into here

579
01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:29.579
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and like niche all the niche, group them right? So so, therefore, because we don't want to see like more than 5, I think 5 is a maximum for sub customer segmentation. Even more than 5 is kind of like headache. You probably need to like group them for some reason, but usually 3 is a golden number in the interview. But you can have more if you find it's natural to have more.

580
01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:37.570
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, good question tips. Oh, good job taking notes this way. Perfect.

581
01:22:37.690 --> 01:22:45.450
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay. Where we are right now. travel, we'll talk about traveler service. Oh, we haven't done service provider. Okay, cool. Now.

582
01:22:46.570 --> 01:22:51.620
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Servicing. She had a service provider is very straightforward, like, basically the travel agency booking.

583
01:22:51.730 --> 01:22:56.230
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Right? All those like hotels, restaurants.

584
01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:03.869
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: straightforward right now, airlines, I think. Airlines very important

585
01:23:04.650 --> 01:23:09.132
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: service providers. Very important, totally right?

586
01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:16.239
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and are we through the airlines? I think rental cars are great.

587
01:23:17.025 --> 01:23:20.150
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Hotels, I I will put

588
01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:26.920
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: airlines, not just police self-run businesses.

589
01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:30.380
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: because they're kind of bigger than different kind of restaurants, right?

590
01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:32.680
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Without planes.

591
01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:34.670
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: How do you travel

592
01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:47.389
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: so I would just move them down here.

593
01:23:47.630 --> 01:23:53.859
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Travel agencies and airlines. Self-drawn businesses, including all those hotels.

594
01:23:54.270 --> 01:23:55.639
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Huh! Huh!

595
01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:58.749
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Rental cars you can put here restaurants.

596
01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:03.529
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Alright, hmm, all of this.

597
01:24:05.210 --> 01:24:07.220
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, yeah, sorry. Let me get some water.

598
01:24:07.330 --> 01:24:08.359
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I'll be right back.

599
01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:46.300
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, now, keep going

600
01:24:46.410 --> 01:24:55.669
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: right. We also need to have those like destination cities which I really enjoy talking about them, because you travel to where

601
01:24:56.200 --> 01:25:02.341
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: San Francisco to Miami, Miami to Boston. Right Destination City, is also very critical

602
01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:07.139
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: as one of the subcustomers like segmentation.

603
01:25:08.725 --> 01:25:14.550
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: If we can group them.

604
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.860
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Hmm! I'm saying we are.

605
01:25:22.919 --> 01:25:28.580
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: We can group the 12 agents. We can group

606
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:31.939
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: we can group all the restaurants

607
01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:45.400
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: like rental cars, group event organizer, restaurant tourist, right? Like tour guide right group, all of them. Next to the rental car services, all of them. Let's group them to here.

608
01:25:48.730 --> 01:25:51.350
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Group them here.

609
01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:59.250
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: including this event. Oh, yeah. Event organizer, including 2 guys. Okay, yeah basic group. All of them here is more clean.

610
01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:15.530
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, we'll group them under something I sell from businesses different kind of like small businesses.

611
01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:23.980
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: small. But basically all those like small service businesses, small service businesses.

612
01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:31.923
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, restaurants. You can rent a car all these.

613
01:26:34.210 --> 01:26:41.390
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you want to guide. All of those basically are the small things and go with together. But we want to

614
01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:43.700
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: to the bigger ones like booking

615
01:26:44.140 --> 01:27:05.120
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: like travel agency booking very straightforward, right? Airline without yeah, without them you couldn't go to places. Then you have different Destination. City. You can arrive in those places. Destination cities in themselves, including an airport, local transportation. I add here, bracket airport local transportation is all goes here

616
01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:14.600
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: right? Because you travel to another place, which is also very critical. Altogether. Okay. So now quickly. So let's go to the

617
01:27:15.390 --> 01:27:19.809
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: the 3rd party, right? So 3rd party could be like

618
01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:30.080
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: beyond these group people. So, for example, Janapur, all the government, which is fine. Yeah, which which is true, because all those like government, have, like airport

619
01:27:30.290 --> 01:27:36.909
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: regulations, like different kind of faa, all of those anything armament government altogether right

620
01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:51.220
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: in terms of travel, and you can include those travel influencers. They provide information regarding travelers. All these good people advertisers. We are the advertising travel.

621
01:27:51.670 --> 01:27:53.159
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You mean people run ads.

622
01:27:56.210 --> 01:28:00.489
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I don't know. There's advertisers online that people don't ask when you book flight.

623
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:03.120
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Maybe it's what.

624
01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:19.370
Tung Vu: I think so. I mean, I don't doubt that that's that's another aspect, right like there must be some advertising. But I think advertising for places like destinations, places, cities, and events or activities. There should be advertised there.

625
01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:29.091
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, let's add it there as well. So high level, we're there straightforward. Okay, I think in a high level, we have like,

626
01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:33.539
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: we have. We have high level things. Correct?

627
01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:44.009
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Cool. Okay? So now keep going. Yeah. Advertiser influencer. We repeat twice. Let's do not repeat twice

628
01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:55.040
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: explaining the the government airports and regulations. Yeah. And then you you do them cool. Okay? Let's do. The influencer. Advertisers are.

629
01:28:55.570 --> 01:28:59.340
Mun Chet: Should I just fall under like brand promoters or promoters?

630
01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:05.979
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You can. You can also put another way to describe promoters. You can. You can all group them on the promoters.

631
01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:06.850
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah.

632
01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:18.360
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: okay, cool. All right. So now keep going high level. And now next part, we don't do pain. Point first.st Yet we do prioritization for the for the speed.

633
01:29:18.510 --> 01:29:21.380
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Let me copy, paste the table for my ta.

634
01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:27.920
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: where is this? Oh.

635
01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:47.269
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: okay, so feel free to change the table. But we we don't use. Let me show for the speed of interview as well. We use this table.

636
01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:53.430
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I was sub customer submitting. We'll do this.

637
01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:58.919
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I am okay. So now here's what we do. Everyone pay. Ta! Take notes here

638
01:30:02.110 --> 01:30:04.449
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: in the prioritization phase given.

639
01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:12.729
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: the trend is giving you very limited time to do multiple cases. Now you're on your fast speed right when you do fast speed

640
01:30:13.552 --> 01:30:24.659
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: when you prioritize the marketplace with highest level of customer segmentation, don't do a table, but talk about

641
01:30:25.110 --> 01:30:26.830
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: basically talking.

642
01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:32.559
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Talk about. Well, 1st of all, let's prioritize different customer segmentations.

643
01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:39.590
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: 1st of all, we do need prioritize. Do we prioritize high level travelers, service providers or 3rd party high level. Tell them

644
01:30:39.870 --> 01:30:41.850
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: well, the way I think about it.

645
01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:48.029
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I need to think about impacts as a market urgency altogether to understand which one prioritize

646
01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:54.910
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: then, but I'm not going to show them this table because the table 3, 2, 5. You add numbers to the table. Right? It will.

647
01:30:56.020 --> 01:30:57.899
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It will take a while to do it.

648
01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:01.170
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But I verbally here take notes. Yeah.

649
01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:03.919
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: so I would. I would just say it.

650
01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:15.380
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I always say it. Do I choose traveler service providers or 3rd parties altogether, which one is, is important. Which side of the marketplace do we prioritize? Well.

651
01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:23.009
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I would consider 3 things size of market impact size market urgency. So what is size market impact urgency means this.

652
01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:32.470
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Then I will just say these in the interview copy paste for you guys.

653
01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:37.090
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I literally say the same sentences in the interview.

654
01:31:37.410 --> 01:31:43.100
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You don't need to modify, because I give you the shortest.

655
01:31:43.330 --> 01:31:47.820
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: A fewer sentences to get to the point faster during the interview.

656
01:31:48.990 --> 01:31:51.140
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Say this, we'll pass the interview.

657
01:31:51.650 --> 01:32:07.320
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: That's right. He's like, okay. So we'll think about those 3 factors. Impact says, market urgency impact means the market means this urgency means this. Each one is one sentence. That's it. So obviously, with all 3 consideration, I'm going to prioritize travelers.

658
01:32:11.460 --> 01:32:19.600
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: They say prototype straightforward. Nothing. We said already, okay, then, what's that? Now? Next up.

659
01:32:19.870 --> 01:32:24.109
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I do need to prioritize sub-customer segmentation of travelers.

660
01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:29.630
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Then you do this table.

661
01:32:32.210 --> 01:32:33.199
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You put it here.

662
01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:37.710
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay?

663
01:32:37.830 --> 01:32:42.720
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Because sub-customer segmentation will. It's less obvious which one to prioritize

664
01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:50.040
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: the one that say, travelers, service provider. All of this more obvious pick one go right.

665
01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:57.880
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: therefore straightforward. Okay. So now and then you said, well, I need to prioritize with the sub customer segmentation and ask question.

666
01:32:58.570 --> 01:33:04.659
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: do you mind? I use 1 min to finish the prioritization for the subcustomer segmentation.

667
01:33:05.630 --> 01:33:11.720
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Just ask this question. The interview is, go ahead. Yeah, 1 min. What's during this 1 min? Here's what you do.

668
01:33:12.410 --> 01:33:14.879
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: The 3 immediately copy. Paste the table.

669
01:33:15.310 --> 01:33:16.959
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You should prepare a table, right.

670
01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:22.489
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: copy, paste the table and plug in the 3 type of sub-customer segmentation for travelers.

671
01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:32.260
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Put it here, which is like a leisure business niche, one to 3. Right here, then, you plug in

672
01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:35.220
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: oops high, medium low.

673
01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:40.189
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: By the way you can do numbers. I forgot how

674
01:33:40.630 --> 01:33:47.580
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you need a 5, 5, 4, 5. All right. You can do numbers. Okay? You can. You can do numbers totally no problem.

675
01:33:49.940 --> 01:33:56.270
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You can also do high medium low either way is fine.

676
01:33:56.590 --> 01:33:59.230
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It totally is always fine.

677
01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:11.820
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: If I go to interview, and I am Nagra Math.

678
01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:16.139
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I'm just gonna hymen and low.

679
01:34:19.140 --> 01:34:25.309
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: if my brain works better, if I give some numbers, give number either way is fine.

680
01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:35.809
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, just just pick something. The goal for me is help. You pass the interview. See the right thing to pass the interview. Okay, high minimum, whatever. Pick it in. And then you you plug it in.

681
01:34:36.610 --> 01:34:54.539
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Basically, let's do high mean. And I think it's easier for everyone who cannot run math on the fly. You cannot run math on the fly. It's just high, medium, low. So we're not very stressed out. You can't run math on the fly. Just do this. Add it up

682
01:34:54.720 --> 01:35:00.190
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: straightforward. Okay, either way is fine, totally totally, not plugging in numbers.

683
01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:03.300
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: La mia.

684
01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:08.060
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Let me have volunteered parking numbers for me.

685
01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:16.000
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: My ta! And can you enter the subcustoma summitation for travelers

686
01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:19.429
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: enter those 3. It should be easy. Just wait a second. Yeah.

687
01:35:19.740 --> 01:35:28.619
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah. Okay. So now let me let me let me. Let me have warrant here.

688
01:35:29.250 --> 01:35:31.359
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You know what. Let's everybody.

689
01:35:31.610 --> 01:35:39.260
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: If you can. Access to the Google Sheet, come here, everybody. You just write down high, minute, low

690
01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:43.600
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: business, Major niche. I won't do this.

691
01:35:45.850 --> 01:35:47.310
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Then she write

692
01:35:48.850 --> 01:36:01.539
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: like high for impact. I made a stuff. Okay, Median, for something urgency. This is low, and next one high high. Make sense for you guys.

693
01:36:01.910 --> 01:36:03.340
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Do a quick scoring.

694
01:36:04.350 --> 01:36:07.259
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Do quick scoring something like that

695
01:36:07.510 --> 01:36:11.269
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: as example above the ones you want to prioritize.

696
01:36:11.530 --> 01:36:17.969
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Make sense to you guys, everyone. Just practice, I mean saying things means nothing. You guys don't take it

697
01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:30.239
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: right. The ghost let an offer, not me lending offer. You guys are an offer. Just say, do something fast. Do something. Hire me now. Just do whatever easiest way to use short amount of time

698
01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:36.270
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: to to help yourself to score it quickly.

699
01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:40.379
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It's a good exercise, a good exercise. Okay?

700
01:37:15.230 --> 01:37:25.910
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah. You can do simple, high medium log. No need to copy, paste the whole table any, anyway? Help you guys to think fast, write something and build the one you want to prioritize

701
01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:32.530
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: like the examples I and give you guys

702
01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:43.439
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: my tier did the job. All the notes looks great at the same time. Let me let me see anything when

703
01:37:52.850 --> 01:37:57.630
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: great, cool above this is important. Pause. Okay.

704
01:38:02.510 --> 01:38:06.760
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: very good. I think. Ta do very good. Such a good job.

705
01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:28.230
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You guys done both the ones you want to prioritize. I want bold business niche.

706
01:38:38.130 --> 01:38:41.790
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, I think I think the the obvious one is the straightforward

707
01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:58.829
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: okay. So most people pick leisure straightforward. Only one person pick niche.

708
01:38:59.970 --> 01:39:07.300
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay. So let me let me show you what I what I think

709
01:39:08.230 --> 01:39:12.709
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: we need to. We need to pick someone's put it here.

710
01:39:16.930 --> 01:39:17.889
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: By the way.

711
01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:33.569
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: the most important is, did you prioritize the right one? Or it's not not, I said. This is Median. Someone said. It's high here, 91. You can make a Median high do a dash in between all right because the goal is a total score.

712
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:35.099
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: The goal is.

713
01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:41.249
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: is this total score for for one of the customer segmentation higher than others. The goal is is that

714
01:39:41.620 --> 01:39:44.069
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: the goal is not to negotiate. And well.

715
01:39:44.590 --> 01:39:48.810
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: this is not 5. I think this is 4 wasting time.

716
01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:57.800
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Did you see, for example, in this in my, on my size, which is highest anyway? Why argue, this is 4 or 5 doesn't matter. It's highest

717
01:39:58.110 --> 01:40:02.060
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: right as example. So as long as you're able to

718
01:40:03.150 --> 01:40:06.929
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: easily pick the right one for your prioritization, you're done.

719
01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:14.380
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay. The the small fine tune is high or medium high in between is not as important.

720
01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:15.760
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay.

721
01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:26.260
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: okay, cool, cool. But we see most most leisure. Only one person doing niche. I want to go for leisure myself as well.

722
01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:33.769
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, so let me let me let me just just use this one as me

723
01:40:34.530 --> 01:40:40.849
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: ta copy. Paste one of these. Here, let's score this together, you know. Pick someone else. Okay.

724
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:48.990
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I want to pick straightforward grace is clearly you pick something

725
01:40:49.630 --> 01:41:02.351
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: who did niche. I think most of them pick leisure. I think leisure is very straightforward, which which means this, and here you can fill in this you can fill in this numbers as you go. Right. So very straightforward.

726
01:41:03.250 --> 01:41:04.709
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I say.

727
01:41:05.484 --> 01:41:14.845
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: oh, oh, oh, let's do! How many law! Let's audit. Do not wrong numbers, because nobody is doing numbers. Right? Let's do how many law, right? So

728
01:41:15.860 --> 01:41:25.490
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: leisure impacts high, I think size market. This is definitely highest, right? This is highest niche median.

729
01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:38.450
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I think business travel also. Median. Right now, urgency. I think the size market very straightforward impact. Which one do. We help has biggest impact. I think I think business is kind of like

730
01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:44.460
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Median. You're just there, anyway. Someone's helping you right? Urgency low.

731
01:41:44.710 --> 01:41:47.220
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you know you just you. You have lots of money

732
01:41:47.850 --> 01:41:54.471
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: to go fly business class, whatever company like. Fine as an example. Right?

733
01:41:56.417 --> 01:42:01.230
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I think the whole thing is he?

734
01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:06.330
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I think this is. I'm sorry it's not, could be high

735
01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:09.259
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: need travel. I do think this is high.

736
01:42:10.990 --> 01:42:14.530
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You could do this. Let me let me see my score here.

737
01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:20.420
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, here is my scores roughly, you know again.

738
01:42:22.190 --> 01:42:24.249
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: for the sake of time, do an interview.

739
01:42:24.390 --> 01:42:30.580
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and altogether we don't want to argue. Is the Median high as as long as you pick the highest one.

740
01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:34.319
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, we don't need to make it in between. But in a high level. Here's what I meant.

741
01:42:34.610 --> 01:42:41.259
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: all right, I think impact. Leisure and niche are both high.

742
01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:44.360
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I felt an urgency, a bow tie.

743
01:42:45.420 --> 01:42:50.150
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: maybe niche is even higher because of niche but

744
01:42:50.770 --> 01:42:52.880
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: says the market for leisure is high.

745
01:42:53.490 --> 01:42:57.730
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Devin Hyatt coming with niche. So therefore, if I go to interview, I will go for this one.

746
01:42:58.950 --> 01:43:05.620
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, oops, maybe make it yellow on team. Yeah. Team make yellow.

747
01:43:05.970 --> 01:43:21.649
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I will go for this one here. You can change any format just like anything each time I do, and make it less pretty than what you had, change anything you want. So in high level, if for the speed I would choose this one, I'll do some high, quick score like this, and we're done.

748
01:43:22.510 --> 01:43:31.829
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay. So now I do want to hear. I see most people. Most people straightforward. Choose. Choose. Dj, I do want to hear someone choose this

749
01:43:34.860 --> 01:43:38.645
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: who did, who choose. You're the only person vote for niche

750
01:43:39.346 --> 01:43:40.413
Cynthia Lin: Think it's me?

751
01:43:41.058 --> 01:43:42.499
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Tell me more, Cynthia, what.

752
01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:42.840
Cynthia Lin: Yeah.

753
01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:44.509
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Niche is higher.

754
01:43:44.510 --> 01:44:04.009
Cynthia Lin: Because for the impact between leisure and niche, I choose leisure as am a medium, because I think a lot of people who, traveling this themselves, they already have the existing tool that they are using so and they, a lot of them, should be

755
01:44:04.060 --> 01:44:27.210
Cynthia Lin: at least able to communicate like using English in other countries. So the the impact for the niche one like people who cannot like family, they don't speak good English, but they take kids to to travel, and like me, if I go to, I go to like Japan. I need to find a restaurant, but I don't know if this there are

756
01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:29.080
Cynthia Lin: case friendly.

757
01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:37.399
Cynthia Lin: So the if this app can help me on this, it will be more impactful. That's why I choose high for niche and medium for leisure.

758
01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:38.150
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I see.

759
01:44:38.150 --> 01:44:38.550
Cynthia Lin: Okay.

760
01:44:38.550 --> 01:44:46.661
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Cool. I think all good argument the same thing as urgency, because the niche more challenges higher urgency. Right? All of these. So now

761
01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:49.340
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I go, for the, I think makes sense.

762
01:44:49.780 --> 01:44:55.909
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Let me show you what another angle of thought about this is. I think, that just size the market is too small.

763
01:44:57.660 --> 01:45:00.870
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And now you're designing trouble for Facebook

764
01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:04.420
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Facebook as a company want to go big.

765
01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:16.889
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: They want to have. We'll talk about why this. Remember this, why data user is going down. Everything is going down. They also want to train the AI. So the more data the better.

766
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:18.930
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So they're going for big.

767
01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:21.020
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So therefore go for this one

768
01:45:22.090 --> 01:45:27.120
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and then says Market, I do think the impact urgency could be high.

769
01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:30.100
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Just the the size is smaller.

770
01:45:30.350 --> 01:45:34.929
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And it's for Facebook. So I go for this one. So therefore, the like.

771
01:45:35.490 --> 01:45:40.540
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: we give more weight here. All right. So now, during the interview, let's say.

772
01:45:41.220 --> 01:45:43.660
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: for some reason you score this way.

773
01:45:44.220 --> 01:45:49.190
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Then you pause. You're like this is Facebook.

774
01:45:50.230 --> 01:45:53.810
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I cannot go for something that's obviously half smarter.

775
01:45:54.290 --> 01:45:55.710
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Nice size market.

776
01:45:56.410 --> 01:45:58.659
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Then you change your score on purpose.

777
01:45:59.810 --> 01:46:04.239
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, and and if if you also have a tie.

778
01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:09.149
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you just modify a score to to pick the one that's

779
01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:12.729
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: whatever make most of the sense.

780
01:46:13.380 --> 01:46:21.740
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Right now, as example, okay. cool trial question.

781
01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:45.038
Tung Vu: Yeah. So I'm thinking that since this is basically your your lesson of saying that if you're in a big company like you pretending to be a Pm. On the big company. Then you have to think bigger, like market impact. Right? But say, this is startup. The question for startup design an app for us. Then then you can basically talk about hey? Why, you chose niche.

782
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.680
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yes.

783
01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:50.150
Tung Vu: As a as a focus, because that's competitive edge for for a startup.

784
01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:51.550
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yes, you can.

785
01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:58.500
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yes, but but yes. But my, my intention. You can use the score if you start up.

786
01:46:59.420 --> 01:47:01.339
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, for that's what I'm asking.

787
01:47:01.340 --> 01:47:07.610
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: yeah, yeah, yeah, you can use a score for startup. But I'm not going to make it too obvious

788
01:47:08.590 --> 01:47:18.120
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: that because I'm startup, I cannot go big. I focus on smaller niche market all startup. If you want to survive in today's market, you go for niche for sure. Right?

789
01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:21.420
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Right? So I'm I'm not going to make it very.

790
01:47:22.380 --> 01:47:35.709
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: because I'm starter of a niche. There's no way to survive, right? So it's like pretending to a score. People, you know. Pretend you do a score. Okay, pretending, at least pretending. And also the the systems helps you to guide

791
01:47:35.820 --> 01:47:39.330
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: your thinking process. Anyway, general question.

792
01:47:40.427 --> 01:47:48.069
Jana Jiang: Do you think choosing different segment like we choose? Niche would fail the interview.

793
01:47:48.430 --> 01:47:50.833
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Like no,

794
01:47:53.340 --> 01:48:00.330
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I don't think you will fail the interview. I think it will make it challenging.

795
01:48:00.590 --> 01:48:01.000
Jana Jiang: Hmm.

796
01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:06.150
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Later on, when we

797
01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:16.639
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: as we, because after, if you choose the wrong customer segmentation or you didn't go for the main thing right then you design, let's say, go for niche. You probably design it for

798
01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:23.020
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: people with disabilities as example or family travel. One of these 2, more likely.

799
01:48:23.230 --> 01:48:29.010
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: All right. And it let's say, if you choose disability, and it's like

800
01:48:29.370 --> 01:48:35.000
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I guarantee you. No, let me ask you which big tech company the app

801
01:48:35.140 --> 01:48:40.320
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: it's good for people with disabilities. They don't even have the icon. To be frank, very frank.

802
01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:48.400
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: they say it where diversity, inclusion, they say it did it show on the app. Facebook has disability app icon. No.

803
01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:52.010
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So therefore, by heart we know it.

804
01:48:52.200 --> 01:49:00.990
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But if you accidentally design niche and you, you might accidentally go out disability sort of that, and then that

805
01:49:01.510 --> 01:49:03.349
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: they don't even have it today.

806
01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:09.600
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: They all know it. They don't say it for political reasons, to be frank.

807
01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:18.440
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: right? So, therefore, this is just preventing you going to the wrong track right? But if you choose niche and it designed for like

808
01:49:19.890 --> 01:49:21.750
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: group travel as example.

809
01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:24.770
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: That's something potentially.

810
01:49:25.540 --> 01:49:39.949
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Meta could well do as example. That will not kill you. If you accidentally go on a path with disabilities, I think we'll kill you for the interview for the purpose, not getting hired by Meta. But it's not for the purpose that you didn't design really great app.

811
01:49:42.170 --> 01:49:47.999
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Their underlying thing. Big tech means doing. They don't say it to you. They market in different ways. To be frank.

812
01:49:48.650 --> 01:49:50.100
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: right? So there's like

813
01:49:50.950 --> 01:50:00.040
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: disabilities, I think biggest help ever like nobody's serving them. Even today. We're doing this case for for many years nobody served them. We're we're on the app

814
01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:01.430
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: to Frank.

815
01:50:02.694 --> 01:50:28.170
Jana Jiang: What if we if we we have the score for both of the segmentation, and it will show the score is pretty close, and I will, let's say there have equal equal score, and I will say, because leisure has bigger market size, so I will prioritize leisure. But on top of that. I still want to give options to meet Traveler.

816
01:50:28.750 --> 01:50:34.009
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: No too complicated. I would just make the niche one of those score lower.

817
01:50:34.350 --> 01:50:35.210
Jana Jiang: Okay.

818
01:50:35.390 --> 01:50:44.220
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I would just make this. I wouldn't make it too complex. I would just make the niche when the scores lower, maybe impact lower urgency lower, or you make like how I do it.

819
01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:51.389
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: High, high for everything niche says market medium, see? And and you don't even argue.

820
01:50:51.790 --> 01:50:52.500
Jana Jiang: Hmm.

821
01:50:53.490 --> 01:50:55.439
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Right to say clearly, it's lower.

822
01:50:56.450 --> 01:51:03.250
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I'm not arguing for other things. I'm saying sales market smaller, and they compare higher. If you score this way

823
01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:05.769
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: is the more obvious winner.

824
01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:15.689
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, to do obvious winners! But try your best to score it first, st but because this thinking process is more like guidance for you to.

825
01:51:16.100 --> 01:51:19.640
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But but this one is more is more straightforward. To be frank.

826
01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:26.179
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: sometimes they're not straightforward sub-customer segmentation. This will do a great help.

827
01:51:28.210 --> 01:51:30.983
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: but no scored union squared. Okay? So now,

828
01:51:31.740 --> 01:51:40.520
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: ta, take notes regarding what to say after you use the table. Right? So after you, you ask for 1 min you score this table, you come back. You said, Well.

829
01:51:41.500 --> 01:51:42.790
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: ta, take notes.

830
01:51:43.630 --> 01:51:44.900
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay. So now

831
01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:49.899
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you say this. Well, as you can see in the table. Let's say the exact same thing in the interview

832
01:51:50.580 --> 01:51:56.189
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: as you can see in this table, I put sub-customer segmentations

833
01:51:56.510 --> 01:52:01.000
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: on the table and compare with 3 key factors, which is impacts as market urgency.

834
01:52:01.816 --> 01:52:05.130
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: As I mentioned earlier, impact means

835
01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:11.579
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: da da, da, I'm going to repeat this again, just in case this person forget about it, and it only takes you one sentence

836
01:52:12.370 --> 01:52:14.289
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: for each of the 3 things

837
01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:18.210
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: literally 10 seconds, like 10 seconds in total.

838
01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:24.839
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: All right. So therefore I'm not going to cut time on that. I cut time in 2 different ways. I will show you. Okay. I never cut time on the framework.

839
01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:29.460
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay? So what you can see this, the impacts of the market urgency. Well.

840
01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:48.489
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: as I mentioned, earlier impact means which customer segmentation, should we help out? Have the biggest impact on the society situation we're in sales. Market means how many people belong to the customer segmentation urgency means? Do you want to solve the problem today or yesterday. Okay, with those 3 in mind, I'm going to prioritize leisure

841
01:52:49.820 --> 01:52:56.580
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and directly jump to the ones you prioritize instead of going through each of them one by one, because we want to save time.

842
01:52:56.830 --> 01:53:00.970
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Remember, 3 framework within 45 min is a trend nowadays.

843
01:53:01.150 --> 01:53:03.360
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So then jump to here leisure.

844
01:53:03.580 --> 01:53:09.379
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So, therefore, prioritize Dj, the reason is that will have the highest impact

845
01:53:09.930 --> 01:53:35.629
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: for leisure nowadays, because lots of leisure, mainly for vacation purposes, right as we can see nowadays there's a lot of delay going through places, and the travel experience. Wasn't that good, anyway? And it destroyed people's like best annual plan vacations or going to Christmas and then not able to get destination. The impact is pretty big nowadays.

846
01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:43.600
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Well, said Mark, clearly, so many people travel for vocation. Fun purposes. See the important. Others manipulate for leisure purposes.

847
01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:47.370
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: right? And urgency.

848
01:53:47.610 --> 01:54:00.059
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: As we mentioned right now, there's there's like people trying to go from place A to Place B. They want to get to the destination with the smoothest experience.

849
01:54:00.330 --> 01:54:08.919
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Now that we've seen so much disruptions in the flight and accidents and delayed disruptions they want to get it dressed. They have the best vacations ever

850
01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:19.489
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: well, and and they can see on the security. We practice leisure first, st as you can see on this table. Wow, another part was niche actually niche pretty high in terms of impact urgency

851
01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:24.639
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: because they have a special needs. They want to get addressed asap bigger impact as well. However.

852
01:54:24.810 --> 01:54:27.580
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: they just have lower market size compared with Dj.

853
01:54:28.852 --> 01:54:31.670
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So therefore, I will still prioritize leisure.

854
01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:41.560
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: for now, if for extra time we may look into niche later on. But, given, this is 45 min case interview. I'm going to look into leisure, for now

855
01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:50.359
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: this is literally going to say in the interview, okay. So therefore, only only talk about the main ones. You want to prioritize others.

856
01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:52.389
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You can mention

857
01:54:53.090 --> 01:55:01.870
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: some kind of differentiating factors. We put some niche is a loser so that we're losing brain because market size is small, but the other 2 pretty high.

858
01:55:02.410 --> 01:55:05.790
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I would just put it out there right. I didn't even want to mention business.

859
01:55:06.260 --> 01:55:08.369
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It's kind of straightforward, right?

860
01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:17.670
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And without wasting time talking about something that's obviously loser, right? If it's kind of close, I will mention some part

861
01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:18.759
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: a little bit.

862
01:55:19.060 --> 01:55:21.190
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay? So that's what I said in the interview.

863
01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:23.060
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Save time.

864
01:55:24.070 --> 01:55:28.270
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Understand? Prioritization is the biggest time waster.

865
01:55:28.919 --> 01:55:33.319
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Ta! Take notes, prioritization, biggest time waster. If you

866
01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:43.560
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: spend lots of time just like talking about prioritization. Just as, therefore, just say the short, concise way I show you here and show the table faster that way.

867
01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:49.460
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay? And then quickly, what have this

868
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:52.419
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: pain point straightforward? Okay, so now

869
01:55:52.916 --> 01:55:59.840
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: as a as a group exercise. I want you to guys to do this point a bit.

870
01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:04.510
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Where's my? Oh, where's oh, dj, okay.

871
01:56:05.110 --> 01:56:10.480
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: pinpoint for leisure in interview one top 3. Best answered.

872
01:56:10.580 --> 01:56:15.050
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: best pain points. Okay for the exercise. I want people same here.

873
01:56:15.430 --> 01:56:17.690
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Write. Help me to write down.

874
01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:23.100
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: By the way, before. Do this after you finish this you say you ask, interpret this question.

875
01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:26.463
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: so therefore pride has leisure.

876
01:56:27.110 --> 01:56:28.940
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Is there anything I missed?

877
01:56:29.903 --> 01:56:33.220
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Always ask? Is there anything I missed

878
01:56:33.860 --> 01:56:39.539
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: in in between issue framework? Always ask, is anything missed? So give the interviewer opportunities

879
01:56:42.110 --> 01:56:46.839
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: to to check in, to guide you? If it's wrong, right? Anything I missed

880
01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:51.369
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: before I move on to the next session, which is Pain Point.

881
01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:53.880
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You can say it that way.

882
01:56:54.750 --> 01:57:03.220
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, usually, if you get right they will get a rate, or they might. You or Interviewer might just try to have a conversation

883
01:57:04.130 --> 01:57:10.540
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: they were like. Hmm, I agree with the leisure. What do you think of niche as example?

884
01:57:11.100 --> 01:57:14.670
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Even if they agree with you, they may

885
01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:19.230
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: just ask some questions, so to have a conversation. To be frank.

886
01:57:20.210 --> 01:57:22.729
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: or even test out your thinking process.

887
01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:31.619
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I also need your script. What do you think of niche? And oh, as I mentioned earlier, it's pretty high in many different ways. Okay, just say smaller size of market.

888
01:57:32.930 --> 01:57:33.799
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: That's it.

889
01:57:34.130 --> 01:57:39.422
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, just have have a small conversation that let the interview lead you

890
01:57:40.340 --> 01:57:47.560
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But usually, when you solve the case in the right way, they will just led your pass.

891
01:57:47.730 --> 01:58:05.920
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay? More likely. Even the questions will be easy. Question. Nothing, nothing too special. Okay, cool. And then so back and forth, anything missed, you know, not missing or asking some small questions. Okay. So now, assuming didn't miss anything and say, Okay, great cool.

892
01:58:06.630 --> 01:58:07.590
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Next tab.

893
01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:14.799
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I need to look into different kind of pain points for this customer segmentation. Do you mind? I spend

894
01:58:15.190 --> 01:58:19.230
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: a minute to brainstorm some pain points. Let's re ask this question.

895
01:58:21.310 --> 01:58:22.820
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It was like, Okay, go ahead.

896
01:58:23.290 --> 01:58:25.260
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, okay. So now.

897
01:58:25.390 --> 01:58:31.729
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I want everybody to this. If you are still live with me, write your answers in the sheet

898
01:58:31.850 --> 01:58:34.979
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: right now in Google docs, same thing. Okay.

899
01:58:35.190 --> 01:58:37.949
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: everybody. You are only allowed to write top 3.

900
01:58:38.980 --> 01:58:43.697
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, just 3 is going to my interview. And because we only want the best of the best.

901
01:58:44.391 --> 01:58:50.619
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: but okay, in the interview you can write more today in the live cases. Let's write 3 per person. Okay?

902
01:58:51.797 --> 01:59:03.500
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: The recommended recommended to write top 3. Today. We everyone. Everyone writes 3. Okay, because I want to see the best

903
01:59:04.050 --> 01:59:08.030
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: what you can think of. And now we have 20 people here.

904
01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:14.549
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I don't want to see 60. Okay, right? Right good ones. Right good ones. Put it here, put it here. Okay.

905
01:59:15.770 --> 01:59:22.849
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: if you, if you agree with others just to do plus one of other people, I did books, and we can do plus one like this

906
01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:30.439
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: if agree with others. Because I don't want to see 60, 30, times 3, 60.

907
01:59:30.750 --> 01:59:37.440
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, okay, do me a favor if it's if agree with other. Do press one

908
02:01:26.940 --> 02:01:34.449
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: question, do you guys experience, or your friends experience? Or you heard of lots of like travel, delay.

909
02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:39.150
Tung Vu: It's supposed to take off at 3 o'clock and then didn't take off.

910
02:01:39.660 --> 02:01:40.769
Tung Vu: Yeah, recently. Yes.

911
02:01:40.770 --> 02:01:45.710
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It. Just this happened. It's always like this, or just recently heard more.

912
02:01:48.490 --> 02:01:49.120
Mun Chet: Hmm.

913
02:01:51.900 --> 02:01:54.009
Tung Vu: Hard to tell that that is hard to tell.

914
02:01:54.560 --> 02:02:00.680
Huanhuan Yue: It happened for me the whole year last year, and this year I haven't been traveling once that

915
02:02:01.010 --> 02:02:02.460
Huanhuan Yue: my slides on time.

916
02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:06.769
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, that happened to.

917
02:02:06.770 --> 02:02:07.350
Mun Chet: That's see.

918
02:02:07.610 --> 02:02:12.740
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, that happened to my nanny. So I have lots of nannies. Yeah, happened to my nannies.

919
02:02:13.010 --> 02:02:18.869
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I have kids. I don't travel as much because of kids. But all my Nanny's travel was delayed

920
02:02:19.410 --> 02:02:30.439
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: interesting. So I'm just wondering, is it that bad before? Maybe Chatgpt knows. But it's bad. Recently.

921
02:02:32.150 --> 02:02:33.010
Yuriy Bihusyak: The weather.

922
02:02:34.230 --> 02:02:36.930
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Maybe the weather all right.

923
02:02:37.190 --> 02:02:38.509
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It was. It was.

924
02:02:39.900 --> 02:02:42.829
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I have limited data, so I don't know. Maybe.

925
02:02:42.830 --> 02:02:44.640
Yuriy Bihusyak: We don't have that much in California.

926
02:02:46.650 --> 02:02:48.030
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I live in Miami.

927
02:02:53.410 --> 02:02:54.390
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I see it.

928
02:02:56.190 --> 02:02:58.650
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Let's read it. I recently.

929
02:02:59.710 --> 02:03:04.670
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, experience

930
02:03:14.010 --> 02:03:17.520
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: is this happening more lately?

931
02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:22.970
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Or it's just my bed.

932
02:03:23.690 --> 02:03:30.740
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: That lock or is, is more.

933
02:03:31.460 --> 02:03:37.300
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It is always like this, maybe those.

934
02:03:41.470 --> 02:03:43.270
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: No, it's not just your luck.

935
02:03:44.570 --> 02:03:48.500
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: A trending upward. Oh, it's trending upward. Okay, okay, okay.

936
02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:51.831
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: it's not just my luck, but not luck.

937
02:03:53.128 --> 02:04:04.549
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: demand search booming. I'm not sure how much. But I think this is how we're solving the case. Air travels booming, major carry 1 billion passenger up

938
02:04:04.840 --> 02:04:16.970
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: increasing. So so increase daily. Peak flight reached exceeded ATM capacity. Oh, exceeded ATM

939
02:04:17.420 --> 02:04:20.642
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: infrastructure, strained. Okay, infrastructure is old.

940
02:04:22.050 --> 02:04:25.079
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: weather? Oh, severe storm said the better

941
02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:29.669
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: globally or recently, better weather. Okay, okay.

942
02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:39.089
Mun Chet: Can relate to the weather. We had like 5 flights the past year, and then me and most of my friends had a delay because of the rains and thunderstorms.

943
02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:51.320
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Interesting on a good it. Failure. Interesting, interesting. Maybe. The recently, the worst weathers global warming stuff.

944
02:04:53.260 --> 02:04:57.278
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Interesting? Interesting. Okay. But anyway, so sidetrack a little bit.

945
02:04:59.160 --> 02:05:20.870
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, by the way, tomorrow I'm announcing an announcement. We're gonna do an event in Boston because I'm in Boston right now. I'm gonna do a meetup event, and people need to sign up if you try for other place to Boston hopefully, your flight is good, if not people in Boston. Let's hang out and cool. So meetup event.

946
02:05:21.070 --> 02:05:23.959
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I'm high risk photographers. Everybody likes

947
02:05:24.100 --> 02:05:36.739
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: places. Okay. But look out for my announcement tomorrow, and I need the local people help me to scout different kind of restaurant bars for us to go to. If you want to volunteer for the scouting trip, let me know.

948
02:05:37.090 --> 02:05:52.569
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: or you have ideas regarding which you go, let me know as well. But anyway, so any plus, I think this one has lots of plus ones. I like those what we have right now as well. But there are different group planning.

949
02:05:56.720 --> 02:06:03.999
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: much times, I know. Lack of experience, time consuming a little time, lack of price. Transparency.

950
02:06:06.883 --> 02:06:12.776
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: fragment experience like for the website. Fragment. Uncertain about local experience. Okay? Cool.

951
02:06:13.480 --> 02:06:15.669
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Why, people don't talk about the

952
02:06:16.320 --> 02:06:22.350
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: let's top pick top 3. Let me let me let me see. The fragrant booking experience is straightforward.

953
02:06:23.850 --> 02:06:27.379
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: finding personal recommendation. How to tailor experience. Okay?

954
02:06:28.047 --> 02:06:34.870
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: High cost, hidden fees, unexpected cost current budgeting. I think these 2 I like

955
02:06:38.420 --> 02:06:39.160
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: me.

956
02:06:50.750 --> 02:06:52.200
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: There's 2 for sure.

957
02:06:56.950 --> 02:07:00.189
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I like this one as well. Group difficult in group planning

958
02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:03.399
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: when everyone has different needs and wants.

959
02:07:04.370 --> 02:07:06.779
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I read this one as well, and

960
02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:14.979
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I see this good as well. Her, too, Taylor.

961
02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:20.740
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I think this group planning personal recommendation.

962
02:07:21.470 --> 02:07:24.112
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and also this is a hard to

963
02:07:25.360 --> 02:07:29.199
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: What? Don't know what to do? What is it? Don't know what to do or what should

964
02:07:30.910 --> 02:07:34.630
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: someone said, don't know what to do. Once you land, once you land.

965
02:07:35.320 --> 02:07:39.360
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: where is hold on! It was here it's disappeared.

966
02:07:39.560 --> 02:07:48.520
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, here, here, I think this include sorry.

967
02:07:49.880 --> 02:07:57.940
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: This thing includes a lot as example. So you said, personal recommendation.

968
02:07:59.330 --> 02:08:07.330
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: including what activity to do. I think this statement number 2 include lots of stuff behind it.

969
02:08:08.690 --> 02:08:12.610
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: inquiring what not to do like.

970
02:08:14.060 --> 02:08:15.760
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I think Rupan is here.

971
02:08:18.600 --> 02:08:20.230
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I see lots of planning.

972
02:08:22.550 --> 02:08:23.500
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I'm off.

973
02:08:24.150 --> 02:08:25.580
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Let's do a planning.

974
02:08:25.970 --> 02:08:28.449
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: The group planning and also different.

975
02:08:31.460 --> 02:08:39.360
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I think, planning a thing. I see recommendation planning also overlap. Let me think about what would I do?

976
02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:43.799
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Booking experience as in straightforward

977
02:08:48.540 --> 02:08:52.759
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: recommendation, based on your personal interest is one thing

978
02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:58.239
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: planning, I think, group planning, other planning. Let's all do. Planning.

979
02:08:59.020 --> 02:09:00.250
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Planning is hard.

980
02:09:00.480 --> 02:09:03.770
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Da la da. And then, when you travel. Your flight delayed.

981
02:09:06.270 --> 02:09:11.980
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: that's a little bit out of Facebook control, but we can write it as a pain point. But we don't prioritize

982
02:09:12.230 --> 02:09:19.530
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: for flight delay. Okay, Tia, help me just write down for the purpose. Documentation flight delays.

983
02:09:21.468 --> 02:09:28.060
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay. So now, we recommendation, personalization.

984
02:09:29.520 --> 02:09:34.640
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Different kind of planning group planning, individual planning the planning.

985
02:09:35.160 --> 02:09:43.440
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, I group them into one thing planning. So I have 3 things personalization planning.

986
02:09:45.271 --> 02:09:54.670
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: group planning, individual planning and booking process. Okay, so now, prioritization, let me.

987
02:09:58.180 --> 02:10:06.470
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: What's my size now we'll prioritize again after I have pain point we prioritize again.

988
02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:09.470
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: This table.

989
02:10:19.700 --> 02:10:26.389
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Me? 1, 0, 3, 4. Okay, I will plug in.

990
02:10:26.950 --> 02:10:31.079
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Ta, help me to plug in this 1, 2, 3.

991
02:10:33.430 --> 02:10:38.859
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Let's do planning this. This one group planning individual planning all go into planning

992
02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:42.829
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: any kind of planning takes a long time to plan

993
02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:51.310
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: put here. So I have 3 things, and then we'll prioritize. Okay. So now let me also help you copy paste. I have written definition.

994
02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:54.240
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: pain, level.

995
02:10:58.870 --> 02:11:06.590
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: ping, level. How many paint says, opportunity urgency out of these? Okay, so now let's let's solve this case together very quickly.

996
02:11:07.813 --> 02:11:16.750
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Pain level permission. Okay? So I want you to.

997
02:11:21.630 --> 02:11:26.340
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: For the, you know what? Let's do. Small group discussion.

998
02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:33.650
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I'm not going to prioritize for you. But you you guys understand what I mean. I give you a demo already using the the table above

999
02:11:34.210 --> 02:11:35.530
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: is in this table.

1000
02:11:36.150 --> 02:11:40.949
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, so we're going to run the same table.

1001
02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:47.860
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But definition is here, pain level. How much pain for each one size of opportunity.

1002
02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:55.389
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, size, opportunity is right here. What it mean is what percent your customer segmentation suffer from the same pain point?

1003
02:11:57.210 --> 02:12:02.689
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Do everybody have trouble in personalization?

1004
02:12:03.130 --> 02:12:06.279
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Do everybody have trouble in trip planning.

1005
02:12:07.150 --> 02:12:09.940
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It's okay for everybody. Just make it high. Okay?

1006
02:12:11.475 --> 02:12:12.450
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Urgency.

1007
02:12:12.810 --> 02:12:15.060
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: How soon they want to address a pain point

1008
02:12:15.940 --> 02:12:18.480
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: can they solve? Do do they want to solve it yesterday.

1009
02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:26.050
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, with this, and you can score as you want, right? And then.

1010
02:12:26.160 --> 02:12:29.580
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: after you have scored this, I want you to.

1011
02:12:30.660 --> 02:12:34.580
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Gimme whatever priorities. Let's say, trip planning.

1012
02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:40.379
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Now let's say it's tree planning. I want to give me 3 solutions.

1013
02:12:41.830 --> 02:12:47.810
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: We'll make a group exercise. Okay, it's it's more fun. I want to see who does better. Then we'll give you 3 solutions

1014
02:12:48.410 --> 02:12:49.580
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: to solve

1015
02:12:49.900 --> 02:13:02.270
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: your trip planning pain points as example. I don't know which one prioritize. Okay, you use this. What? The 3 solutions to solve the trip planning pinpoint? You give me 3 solution. Okay? Then

1016
02:13:03.390 --> 02:13:05.110
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you give me the trade-off

1017
02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:10.999
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and pick the best solution for me.

1018
02:13:13.580 --> 02:13:19.579
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Trade ups. Here, put it on the table. Okay? Again, I want you guys to understand this

1019
02:13:19.780 --> 02:13:26.490
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: that do not once, once we put you guys in a small group discussion, do not argue.

1020
02:13:27.267 --> 02:13:37.590
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: This is 4. This is fine. Doesn't matter. Do roughly, roughly. Solution number one is the best right. Everybody agree. Agree, agree roughly, roughly. Great cool.

1021
02:13:37.900 --> 02:13:47.590
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: This is the one doesn't matter. It's 4 or 5. As long as the total score makes solution number one, the number one, we're we're good. Okay, save time. Same thing in the interview as well.

1022
02:13:47.770 --> 02:13:56.420
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, so what we are going to do is we already agree on.

1023
02:13:57.180 --> 02:14:02.789
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: We'll have the pain point. You know, the pain point processes you want created solutions.

1024
02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:05.279
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and then rank, which solution is the best

1025
02:14:06.410 --> 02:14:10.869
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: based on, based on the framework here. Now let me also copy, paste the definition of this framework here.

1026
02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:14.439
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: This is fun.

1027
02:14:19.700 --> 02:14:25.530
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: There are. So I. My brain is full of solutions. Right now I have to hold it.

1028
02:14:26.002 --> 02:14:29.260
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So that you guys can think about it. Okay?

1029
02:14:29.430 --> 02:14:37.109
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And a solution. There's so many good solutions right now, and probably industry need to be re-innovated.

1030
02:14:37.620 --> 02:14:48.970
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, cool. For the sake of everyone's learning. Let me review the framework for like a solutioning. Right? Solutioning, I think, is straightforward.

1031
02:14:49.100 --> 02:14:56.360
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You know what it is and also not let me elaborate in the trade-off session.

1032
02:14:58.930 --> 02:15:05.739
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: If you talk about, let's say, trade off one solution number one. AI AI powered trip planning

1033
02:15:05.980 --> 02:15:09.490
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: AI agent. Plan everything for you. Solution number 2.

1034
02:15:13.670 --> 02:15:28.040
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I don't know what's better than for, like a Facebook friends a chat. Chatbot integration, whatever stuff one or 3. Okay, so now.

1035
02:15:29.020 --> 02:15:29.920
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: trade-off.

1036
02:15:31.220 --> 02:15:34.969
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: In your interview you will be asked trade-off questions a lot.

1037
02:15:35.470 --> 02:15:38.609
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: What do you think this solution is better than others? What do you think

1038
02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:46.090
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you can use this framework? This framework is so powerful? Oh, the AI agent versus human!

1039
02:15:46.260 --> 02:15:51.600
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Well, why do you think AI Asian is better as example? And then your answer will be like

1040
02:15:53.965 --> 02:15:58.350
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: was because higher effectiveness, engineering effort.

1041
02:15:58.950 --> 02:16:03.130
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: medium. There's a lot of AI agent in the market right now.

1042
02:16:03.880 --> 02:16:09.250
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Implementation EE median risk.

1043
02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:23.000
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, there's some risk. What if AI hallucinates? That's not good. So we still need to do. Put human in the loop towards the end. When people ask you, trade off, those are 4 things you consider again. You can add more things to this

1044
02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:31.760
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: corner cases, anything, other things but but this give you really great trade-off thinking process

1045
02:16:32.590 --> 02:16:34.200
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: after you run the trade-off.

1046
02:16:34.420 --> 02:16:36.069
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Then you know which one is the best

1047
02:16:37.990 --> 02:16:45.539
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: straightforward. Okay, it's scare. But I do want to highlight regarding the risk. Sometimes low risk

1048
02:16:45.740 --> 02:16:49.180
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you give a high score is opposite.

1049
02:16:51.030 --> 02:16:56.370
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: High score means low risk. Okay? Same thing, ease of implementation.

1050
02:16:56.600 --> 02:17:01.699
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, let me define this ease of implementation. I think this is hardest for people to to understand

1051
02:17:03.260 --> 02:17:08.270
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: how easy to make customers adopt, buy and use and implement the solution.

1052
02:17:09.719 --> 02:17:12.620
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: For example, legal constraint, user trust.

1053
02:17:12.889 --> 02:17:15.710
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So sometimes, when your product is perfectly built.

1054
02:17:16.950 --> 02:17:19.130
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But customer doesn't want to use it

1055
02:17:20.549 --> 02:17:24.199
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: is here means ease, ease of implementation.

1056
02:17:27.670 --> 02:17:28.530
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay?

1057
02:17:30.770 --> 02:17:32.139
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: This is what's about.

1058
02:17:33.389 --> 02:17:39.609
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, cool. We are going to do breakout rooms. I I think this is very straightforward. It's also very fun.

1059
02:17:40.240 --> 02:17:46.370
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I have so many ideas already. But I give it to you guys. Okay, presentation should be easy. Pick one.

1060
02:17:46.570 --> 02:17:57.939
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Give me 3 ideas and then do some trade off. Understand? It's good or bad, different kind of risk behind things straightforward. Okay, so now, breakout rooms. Senior. Pm, versus non-senior. Pm.

1061
02:18:00.450 --> 02:18:02.429
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: a camera on everybody.

1062
02:18:02.690 --> 02:18:06.170
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Do you know you need you can change your zoom background. Let me show you.

1063
02:18:07.809 --> 02:18:15.379
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Can the in group sessions make sure to change your zoom background. See?

1064
02:18:15.549 --> 02:18:20.879
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Important enough. Don't forget to do a zoom background PIN, click here announcement

1065
02:18:21.709 --> 02:18:30.990
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: in the disco. Okay, so in announcement, you link back here, you can download transition to Pm, senior, pm.

1066
02:18:31.100 --> 02:18:37.989
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: 8. Pm, okay, so change of zoom background, everybody. So now again, let me demo again.

1067
02:18:38.100 --> 02:18:41.150
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Office hour, channel, Sunday office hours.

1068
02:18:41.600 --> 02:18:51.139
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: In Mala's announcement. There is something important note here when you change your zoom background and click it, give you to the original picture we use all the time.

1069
02:18:55.120 --> 02:19:01.369
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, straightforward. I want you to change your zoom background and then turn on your zoom camera.

1070
02:19:02.219 --> 02:19:04.510
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: camera on camera, on camera

1071
02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:15.169
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: camera. I want to see how many senior pm, versus non senior. Pm.

1072
02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:18.720
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Senior versus non-senior senior versus non-senior

1073
02:19:23.190 --> 02:19:28.770
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: senior, non-senior senior, non-senior. Let me see. Let me see, half half. So far.

1074
02:19:29.160 --> 02:19:35.280
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: so far, it's half half okay, so let me do breakout rooms.

1075
02:19:36.870 --> 02:19:38.450
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, so far. Half.

1076
02:19:38.850 --> 02:19:39.670
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay.

1077
02:19:47.690 --> 02:19:49.490
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: 3. A open rooms.

1078
02:19:51.700 --> 02:19:53.939
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, let me let me do

1079
02:19:54.080 --> 02:19:56.669
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: 20 min. Okay, it's 20 min more than enough.

1080
02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:01.869
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Let me think about this. Okay, open all rooms. Okay? So everybody. Here's what's going on.

1081
02:20:02.050 --> 02:20:08.049
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I have 2 rooms. Senior. Pm, go to room one transition to Pm, go to Room 2.

1082
02:20:08.360 --> 02:20:13.210
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, you have 20 min. I want to finish the framework. As I mentioned earlier.

1083
02:20:14.300 --> 02:20:18.609
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: just prioritize whatever pain point, I think, should be straightforward and come back

1084
02:20:18.780 --> 02:20:23.429
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: to present your solutions and pain. Point for me. But treat it as an interview.

1085
02:20:23.600 --> 02:20:24.929
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Interview is fast

1086
02:20:25.340 --> 02:20:34.420
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: fast speed, speed. Speed. Okay, fast, 20 min. And then one person for each team represent your team to present your outcome for me.

1087
02:20:34.580 --> 02:20:37.219
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: This is a very fun case. So far. So much fun.

Huanhuan Yue: Thank you.

1096
02:21:18.890 --> 02:21:25.359
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Senior Pm. Room one span Pm. Room 2, 3. Dot breakout room, 3 dots per column.

1097
02:21:31.270 --> 02:21:33.009
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Sweet. Ask breakout room.

1098
02:21:36.810 --> 02:21:38.460
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Nasiba interjoyed.

1099
02:21:38.560 --> 02:21:40.819
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: One of those you can see

1100
02:21:44.200 --> 02:21:45.659
Nassiba Rehan: Where is it?

1101
02:21:45.820 --> 02:21:48.430
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Let me let me let me let me help you.

1102
02:21:48.430 --> 02:21:52.220
Yuriy Bihusyak: There is like 4 squares on the bottom, says, join break room.

1103
02:21:52.350 --> 02:21:54.469
Yuriy Bihusyak: breakout room, connect with the 3 dots.

1104
02:21:57.010 --> 02:22:01.530
Nassiba Rehan: Oh, I can see 3 of you! That's it, like my picture.

1105
02:22:01.530 --> 02:22:03.630
Yuriy Bihusyak: Zoom zoom menu on the bottom.

1106
02:22:04.280 --> 02:22:08.380
Nassiba Rehan: Oh, yeah. Room one, am I? Room one.

1107
02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:12.000
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: City, Pm. Room one as Brian, Pm. Room 2.

1108
02:22:13.170 --> 02:22:16.879
Nassiba Rehan: I am spiring.

1109
02:22:17.730 --> 02:22:20.029
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, let me repeat. Room 2

1110
02:22:21.780 --> 02:22:25.130
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yuri, which? Which room you wanna go? Sydney? Pm.

1111
02:22:25.590 --> 02:22:26.598
Yuriy Bihusyak: I don't wanna go.

1112
02:22:26.850 --> 02:22:28.790
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, you know the result.

1113
02:22:29.160 --> 02:22:31.380
Yuriy Bihusyak: I don't wanna share my seat.

1114
02:22:35.700 --> 02:22:44.600
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I think we quickly get it done. And when you launch, the product is a race, I think AI thing is a race to market right now

1115
02:22:46.280 --> 02:22:47.600
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: is raised to market.

1116
02:22:47.890 --> 02:22:51.610
Yuriy Bihusyak: Well, I got to identify 2

1117
02:22:52.160 --> 02:22:57.270
Yuriy Bihusyak: competitors of ours, but they all dead. Nothing happening.

1118
02:22:57.790 --> 02:23:03.480
Yuriy Bihusyak: They just make like 2 announcement on Linkedin. I went to their website. Nothing.

1119
02:23:04.060 --> 02:23:07.000
Yuriy Bihusyak: Maybe they developing something. But so far.

1120
02:23:09.280 --> 02:23:09.960
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Hmm!

1121
02:23:11.340 --> 02:23:19.064
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Cool finish up lunch. Let me go to their rooms. Let me let me finish teaching

1122
02:23:20.260 --> 02:23:24.289
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: cool. Feel free to stay or wash their rooms.

1123
02:23:24.720 --> 02:23:26.347
Yuriy Bihusyak: I go to. I go watch the.

1124
02:49:07.230 --> 02:49:10.790
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, everybody's back. I'm very excited

1125
02:49:11.400 --> 02:49:16.120
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: to hear about all your ideas.

1126
02:49:16.860 --> 02:49:25.870
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It's found actually very fun to create travel. App. Let's have the senior Pm. Team present first.st

1127
02:49:27.753 --> 02:49:31.620
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Who's gonna present? Senior? Pm.

1128
02:49:33.582 --> 02:49:40.544
Huanhuan Yue: Understand? I'm yeah, sure and feel free to yeah. Feel free to chime in

1129
02:49:40.930 --> 02:49:42.230
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Hmm! True to the market.

1130
02:49:42.230 --> 02:49:42.900
Huanhuan Yue: India.

1131
02:49:43.500 --> 02:49:52.420
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, treat it as a market interview. Right? So we just ended, there are different. Where? What are the pain points? Okay? And then continue. It's a mark interview.

1132
02:49:53.150 --> 02:50:03.809
Huanhuan Yue: Okay, yeah. Well, starting with the PIN point. So there are 3 PIN point that we consider. So the 1st one being booking fragmentation where you have to go to different places.

1133
02:50:03.970 --> 02:50:07.070
Huanhuan Yue: to be able to plan, walk.

1134
02:50:07.330 --> 02:50:13.760
Huanhuan Yue: and execute your trips. The second pinpoint that we listed is the planning, the trip

1135
02:50:13.980 --> 02:50:16.699
Huanhuan Yue: that naturally has a lot of

1136
02:50:16.920 --> 02:50:30.989
Huanhuan Yue: activity involved, whereas everyone like people may have different ideas where they want to go on, and different days. A lot of headaches, usually when it comes to planning, and then the last one for travel personalization.

1137
02:50:31.240 --> 02:50:50.899
Huanhuan Yue: So for this one, everyone has a different idea of how they like to travel, what kind of event that they want to do? So we listed this based on for example, pain, level size of the opportunity and urgency. So the 1st one that we listed being the highest is the booking fragmentation

1138
02:50:51.473 --> 02:50:56.459
Huanhuan Yue: nowadays there's not an app exists for the marketplace that everything

1139
02:50:56.570 --> 02:51:09.490
Huanhuan Yue: it's consolidated in one area so that's very high pinpoint. And that happened across the board. If these is addressed, then it will give us a huge opportunity.

1140
02:51:10.090 --> 02:51:17.309
Huanhuan Yue: And then, yeah, that's we listed as the highest. So John said, You want me to go down to this next 2 as well.

1141
02:51:18.320 --> 02:51:18.830
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: No.

1142
02:51:19.250 --> 02:51:29.540
Huanhuan Yue: Okay, so based on how we rain our rank, our pain points, we want to target on booking fragmentation.

1143
02:51:30.211 --> 02:51:48.610
Huanhuan Yue: There are 4 solutions that we've listed. So the 1st one is having one integrated app for all of the purpose. So now for for planning, for execution, we have different apps out there. But if in the ideal world, where everything is in one place.

1144
02:51:48.740 --> 02:51:59.029
Huanhuan Yue: that user can just do everything in there, this would be highly effective and be able to solve all of our pain points.

1145
02:51:59.618 --> 02:52:14.929
Huanhuan Yue: The next solution that we posted is AI travel agents, and these not only target towards solo travel travelers, but also group travelers being able to talk to this agent and be able to book a plan book and execute your itinerary for you

1146
02:52:15.545 --> 02:52:22.289
Huanhuan Yue: even so, during the trip you can even ask AI agent questions. As you are going through your travel.

1147
02:52:22.520 --> 02:52:26.969
Huanhuan Yue: the next one is being able to shop other people's itinerary.

1148
02:52:27.200 --> 02:52:52.399
Huanhuan Yue: So these come about, for example, when we have bachelor trips or going on a group vacation or a government is promoting some sort of travel in their own country to promote tourism. And we're able to see travel influencers or friends or families who've been to a certain country, you can directly book their itinerary

1149
02:52:52.670 --> 02:53:06.400
Huanhuan Yue: from these applications. The last one is, travel based on travel style. Some people who prefer, for example, more adventurous travel style, and they will follow that blogger and be able to

1150
02:53:07.079 --> 02:53:29.039
Huanhuan Yue: do similar activities that that person has done. So this is another solution that we've ranked. But look overall looking at different effectiveness, engineering, ease of use and risk. We finalize that AI travel agent is the most effective when it comes to solving the segmented booking

1151
02:53:29.350 --> 02:53:30.760
Huanhuan Yue: problem that we have.

1152
02:53:31.341 --> 02:53:39.370
Huanhuan Yue: Yeah. Senior. AI. Sorry all the Senior Pm, if you have any ideas that you want to or comment. You want to add, feel free

1153
02:53:39.510 --> 02:53:40.360
Huanhuan Yue: this one.

1154
02:53:45.510 --> 02:54:01.629
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Good. Okay, you do have no comment. I think pretty good. I I like the solutions. The presentation is good. During interview. Make sure to describe. What do you mean by ease of implementation? Like engineering effort? All of these you need to describe

1155
02:54:02.280 --> 02:54:09.780
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: during the interview. Okay, at the same time. Risk not during the interview. Everyone pay attention. Ta, take notes.

1156
02:54:10.170 --> 02:54:18.339
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay. So during the interview risk session, you can say, risk high, low, what are different things right? But you still need to say.

1157
02:54:18.470 --> 02:54:19.990
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: what are the risks?

1158
02:54:20.550 --> 02:54:28.250
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You put? Risk? 4. Which means not 5, right? 4 means a little bit risk. So what is the risk?

1159
02:54:28.360 --> 02:54:29.540
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You should say it

1160
02:54:30.620 --> 02:54:36.770
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: so you can say effectiveness pretty high as you go, and then the risk is 4 out of 5.

1161
02:54:36.900 --> 02:54:46.350
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Here is the risk, potentially AI will hallucinate, or I think, well.

1162
02:54:46.700 --> 02:55:00.640
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: yeah, that's a risk, or accidentally hallucinate. And book you from Miami to San Francisco, and then you land in China. Oh, in big trouble. You need to say it for recession.

1163
02:55:01.110 --> 02:55:07.800
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Right? What are the risks and other things? Just describe the title, the meaning which way I gave you already. Okay.

1164
02:55:07.800 --> 02:55:08.899
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I think I guess.

1165
02:55:08.900 --> 02:55:09.540
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Very good.

1166
02:55:09.760 --> 02:55:12.769
Huanhuan Yue: Do you go through each single solution and talk well?

1167
02:55:12.870 --> 02:55:13.410
Huanhuan Yue: Each.

1168
02:55:13.410 --> 02:55:13.920
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: No.

1169
02:55:13.920 --> 02:55:17.909
Huanhuan Yue: Categories here? Or do you only pick the ones that you choose as your final? Okay.

1170
02:55:18.110 --> 02:55:29.959
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Pick the one so follow the same style. That's why, for this session I let you guys do it because give you the style as well. So everything as everything. You take notes, everything. As long as you put a table here

1171
02:55:30.410 --> 02:55:37.800
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you are only required to talk about the title of the table. So the the meaning of the framework.

1172
02:55:38.100 --> 02:55:42.819
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and then, plus your number one choice based on prioritization

1173
02:55:43.280 --> 02:55:49.000
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and number trains for each of the 4 things in the table.

1174
02:55:49.870 --> 02:56:00.409
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: What are the risks? What's the effectiveness? What do you mean by high effectiveness? And you can like a little bit explanation right? But now, for other things. You can just say

1175
02:56:00.640 --> 02:56:02.800
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: as you can see on this table,

1176
02:56:05.310 --> 02:56:20.979
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: other other solutions. It's not as good, but there's some pretty close enough, for example, shop other people's itinerary. It's pretty effective solutions. However, it's lacking this and this and this you can, you can. You can.

1177
02:56:21.090 --> 02:56:31.949
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You can pick one thing of other losers. I don't want to say losers winner, loser. You pick one thing or one or 2 things of other losers as you want to highlight.

1178
02:56:32.240 --> 02:56:34.820
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: but I wouldn't pick the ones. That's obvious.

1179
02:56:35.560 --> 02:56:37.480
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Whatever you think interview need to know.

1180
02:56:38.220 --> 02:56:40.660
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Right beside this, I think pretty good, just like

1181
02:56:41.350 --> 02:56:52.579
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I read this in shop. Other people's itinerary is pretty good, they said, and I think a very good idea looks like your rank. Effectiveness is low, which means the modification might be, might be harder for you

1182
02:56:53.330 --> 02:57:02.370
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: as example. Right then you just say it a pretty good across the board, but keywords, as you can, as you can see on the table

1183
02:57:02.570 --> 02:57:04.829
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: means, you can see I don't read everything.

1184
02:57:05.500 --> 02:57:11.989
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: This is also sharp. Other people idea pretty good. However, it is lacking the effectiveness, because

1185
02:57:12.280 --> 02:57:21.199
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: what if I want to modify a little bit, be me and Jenna in general, it's pretty good, but modification kind of lacking. So that's probably make it less effective, but but

1186
02:57:21.470 --> 02:57:27.680
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: pretty good. But still AI agent is best. So that's our thing. But I'm not going to say everything.

1187
02:57:27.980 --> 02:57:42.129
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: because other, I think something that you clearly rank or lower, whatever just choose to say things you want to point out, but only choose to say maximum, 2 more likely one for that thing

1188
02:57:42.460 --> 02:57:48.960
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: that you want to highlight about other loser solutions.

1189
02:57:53.900 --> 02:57:59.720
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, so that's that's how you save time and get to the point faster

1190
02:57:59.900 --> 02:58:05.000
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and and say, as you can see in the table, okay?

1191
02:58:06.150 --> 02:58:13.329
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Who team 2 aspiring? Pm, let me see your idea

1192
02:58:14.890 --> 02:58:22.169
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: who is going to present the presentation is good. By the way, yeah, just needs to talk about the framework. It seems straightforward.

1193
02:58:22.670 --> 02:58:24.159
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: The idea is good as well.

1194
02:58:29.020 --> 02:58:30.879
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And who's the presenting team? 2

1195
02:58:31.050 --> 02:58:33.630
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: man who's gonna present your team.

1196
02:58:36.960 --> 02:58:40.220
Mun Chet: I don't think we have a specific person, but I can go for it and give it a try.

1197
02:58:40.220 --> 02:58:41.700
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, yeah. Go ahead.

1198
02:58:43.800 --> 02:58:45.160
Mun Chet: Share this.

1199
02:58:47.010 --> 02:58:59.010
Mun Chet: We also ran out of time for a little bit. But let's get into this. Yes, so based on the 3 rankings that we have. We went with the planning trip as the highest

1200
02:59:00.338 --> 02:59:04.949
Mun Chet: and then the solutions right here that we came with are the AI agents.

1201
02:59:04.950 --> 02:59:11.830
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Trademark interview, trademark interview you need to tell me about highest Y is highest.

1202
02:59:12.510 --> 02:59:19.110
Mun Chet: Yes, so the booking fragmentation part. So as this coming from personally as

1203
02:59:19.270 --> 02:59:48.510
Mun Chet: the person that has been booking a lot, or compared to the people that doesn't book a lot. I think this pays on the medium pain level as it could be done by research or just personal experience, but the planning part is most of the time that people does not have any experience or doesn't want to do the work, and it takes a long time. That's why it's like rate the highest or pain point. And then the personalization. Personally, it's like in the lower side. Because sometimes people just wanted to have their own, or it doesn't have to come.

1204
02:59:48.510 --> 02:59:59.500
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Quick feedback. Everyone pay attention when you present. Don't present this way. Don't present vertically. Present this way horizontally. Okay, pick the one you prioritize, which is trip planning.

1205
02:59:59.610 --> 03:00:15.870
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You can talk about trip planning. We prioritize trip planning. The pain point was because pain level is highest was because of clearly is also very high. Urgency is so high. Well, for other features as you can see on this table.

1206
03:00:16.450 --> 03:00:19.640
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: then you can pick one thing of the thing

1207
03:00:19.980 --> 03:00:22.199
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you. You want to talk about end.

1208
03:00:22.430 --> 03:00:45.240
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I'm not even going to talk about personal travel, personalization, because if low, low, low, low across the board I kind of waste the time, right? Based on your based on, as you can see on the table, right? So probably gonna pick one thing booking fragmentation at the thing you. You want to share with interviewer, but present this way.

1209
03:00:45.680 --> 03:00:47.459
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: horizontal, not vertical.

1210
03:00:48.226 --> 03:00:48.759
Mun Chet: Sounds, good.

1211
03:00:48.967 --> 03:00:49.590
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Start over again.

1212
03:00:49.590 --> 03:00:50.170
Mun Chet: Feedback.

1213
03:00:50.170 --> 03:00:51.229
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And tell me.

1214
03:00:52.317 --> 03:01:13.886
Mun Chet: yes. So planning trip, is the highest ranking. For us, based on the paint level size opportunities and the urgency, as we can see right here. So the reason why we ranked as the highest one is the planning trip. Usually people does not want to spend too much time and work into it on top of the time, that they might not have an idea what they want to do.

1215
03:01:14.830 --> 03:01:26.436
Mun Chet: and then the size of the opportunity. We also ranked as high because this is also larger. Pain points to majority of the populations, and then the urgency. We also rank that as high.

1216
03:01:26.980 --> 03:01:39.669
Mun Chet: that this is the market that we can put into breaking to do it, and then, as you can see right now. It is considered to us like a higher score. From planning and booking fragmentation and then travel. Personalization is

1217
03:01:40.410 --> 03:01:58.875
Mun Chet: could be sorry. Sorry. Let me think that booking fermentation is sort of closer to the total score. But then it is on the lower side, because the based on the pain level and the size of opportunity. And then the urgency, and then the for the travel personalization. We rank it as the lowest one. Because

1218
03:01:59.490 --> 03:02:05.790
Mun Chet: well, the urgency, and then the pain level, since it's usually is not that much of a problem to other people, and it's more of the add on.

1219
03:02:06.990 --> 03:02:14.941
Mun Chet: And then for the solutions we came up with 3 right here. The AI. We actually combined the AI agent and Chatbot

1220
03:02:15.540 --> 03:02:24.069
Mun Chet: as one. And then we, the second one we have is a personalized trade, then, travel agent, a human yeah. And then the moonshot AR for the trip.

1221
03:02:24.300 --> 03:02:38.899
Mun Chet: Yes. We also have it. We're down to the solutions. The chat box and the AI agent with the Meta app feature that consolidates trip, planning into like a single dashboard like an AI chat box integrated into like the Metas messaging platform.

1222
03:02:39.360 --> 03:02:56.010
Mun Chet: And then the personalized travel agent straightforward. It's a person with a certain experience and then can guide it, based on your criteria and the moonshot one is integrated with the Meta AI technology, user can virtually walk through destinations like activities like glasses. With your mobile device and things like that.

1223
03:02:56.330 --> 03:02:57.260
Mun Chet: And

1224
03:02:57.390 --> 03:03:22.160
Mun Chet: for this the total score came out, the AI agent and chat box one between the highest one. So it is, in conclusion. It is the highest effectiveness. One but, on the other hand, and there's also some engineering effort that goes into it. That's why we just give it a 3. And then the ease of implementation we actually put 4 and then the risk we put 2 as low. The risk.

1225
03:03:22.589 --> 03:03:34.039
Mun Chet: That came up with the 14 so effectiveness. AI as we already know. It's pretty effective. You put in your criteria and it gives you like. I said. Your personalization almost instantly.

1226
03:03:34.437 --> 03:03:48.300
Mun Chet: The engineering effort that goes into it. It's even though there's still some effort comes into as long as you have like a base once you have the front end work done. It can start implementing. And then there's less further work. Toward the end

1227
03:03:48.823 --> 03:04:06.420
Mun Chet: and then the risk implementation. We also put forward. So slides were the easy side to use, and then the risk part. Since AI, there's also like some risk going to it like the broken down engine back end, or similar things like that happen. So there's also some risk into it.

1228
03:04:06.900 --> 03:04:20.686
Mun Chet: And the personalized travel agent, we actually rent it as a second. It is highly it's also somewhat worth a higher effective side. Since it's also like a personal agent, someone that has like that experience that goes into it.

1229
03:04:21.170 --> 03:04:24.269
Mun Chet: but it's slightly lower, because AI is probably still better.

1230
03:04:26.112 --> 03:04:29.267
Mun Chet: for the moonshot AR one we also ranked like the lowest one.

1231
03:04:29.770 --> 03:04:31.730
Mun Chet: it could be effective.

1232
03:04:32.510 --> 03:04:41.280
Mun Chet: But at the end of the day. Like like lowers and things like that. But then it's actually hires engineering work into it, and then the harder to implement into it

1233
03:04:41.800 --> 03:04:55.759
Mun Chet: so recommend the personalized AI agent and chat box because of the scalability. So once you develop the model can be delivering trip design to like millions of people. At the same time. The speed of delivery. The cost effectiveness. For customers.

1234
03:04:56.200 --> 03:04:56.930
Mun Chet: Nope.

1235
03:05:00.700 --> 03:05:06.209
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Pretty good given the 1st time you present you follow the framework very well.

1236
03:05:06.600 --> 03:05:15.010
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: but some of these are not specific enough. Let me give you examples. For example, the risk

1237
03:05:16.030 --> 03:05:17.390
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you said.

1238
03:05:19.571 --> 03:05:25.900
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: There are some risks for AI, because the back engine might break, not specific enough.

1239
03:05:26.570 --> 03:05:31.869
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Beat. What do you mean by back the the moonshot? Also? Back engine, my brick

1240
03:05:32.370 --> 03:05:36.450
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: as example. Right? But what do you mean by backend? You might break. So what does mean break.

1241
03:05:36.640 --> 03:05:43.150
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, brave means a hallucinate or means it booked the wrong trip.

1242
03:05:43.440 --> 03:05:46.419
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: All means ghost. You

1243
03:05:46.550 --> 03:05:53.830
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: doesn't book right? So what do you mean? And now not understand this, you make the risk 2 means

1244
03:05:54.030 --> 03:05:56.280
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: higher risk compared with other risk.

1245
03:05:56.760 --> 03:06:16.239
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Right? So you need to be specific regarding there's a couple risks. Number one may hallucinate number 2. It may break in the back engine, which I still don't. I just don't understand what you mean by back engine break. What does it mean? You be specific, it will hallucinate. It might book the wrong thing.

1246
03:06:16.610 --> 03:06:25.370
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and you don't even know you go on the wrong plane. You land, the wrong city. Oh, big trouble. That's what I want to say. Okay.

1247
03:06:26.710 --> 03:06:32.790
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: like, same as a description of other frame for some easel implementation. It's all pretty easy to implement.

1248
03:06:33.513 --> 03:06:37.070
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Be a little bit more specific, right? So I can describe

1249
03:06:38.380 --> 03:06:48.969
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: AI agent now that AI Chatbot, AI agent, has been a known thing. Well, AI agents are not as known. But AI Chatbot is easy implement, right? So the

1250
03:06:49.720 --> 03:06:53.340
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: easy implementation now now, AI is you can describe like

1251
03:06:53.490 --> 03:07:03.819
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: AI is quite popular technology nowadays. Lots of big tech company has been using and experimenters already. So implementation for AI technology is not that hard nowadays.

1252
03:07:04.480 --> 03:07:09.369
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So a little bit more. Everything but one more sentence be more specific.

1253
03:07:09.480 --> 03:07:15.170
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I think it's throughout the entire framework and same thing as go scroll up, scroll up

1254
03:07:18.336 --> 03:07:24.521
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: same thing as the the pain levels. Especially you said

1255
03:07:25.780 --> 03:07:39.820
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: planning trip. The urgency is high, I think when you say urgency is high, you said, because a lot of people need planning trip. No, no, a lot of people need planning trips. That says the meeting is high. Urgency high is like

1256
03:07:42.430 --> 03:07:49.180
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: no solution help with the plan. There's no good solutions right now doesn't exist.

1257
03:07:49.290 --> 03:07:51.379
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And I want to solve the problem yesterday.

1258
03:07:52.290 --> 03:07:57.280
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So therefore it's high urgency. So bees

1259
03:07:57.610 --> 03:08:13.739
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: best. I think each of these description in the framework need to be more specific. All of these same thing as a low personalization. Urgency is low, sales, opportunity low, everything be specific. So you can choose not to talk about it.

1260
03:08:15.120 --> 03:08:23.479
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: If you choose to talk about, let's say I still choose to talk about travel personalization. But I'm going to say this.

1261
03:08:23.950 --> 03:08:28.179
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: As you can see, travel. Personalization is pretty low in all the factors.

1262
03:08:28.420 --> 03:08:33.050
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Specifically, for example, urgency is lowest.

1263
03:08:34.330 --> 03:08:41.360
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Da da da one sentence, let's say, travel, presentation, urgency, slow, or why slow?

1264
03:08:46.020 --> 03:08:51.709
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: People already like know what they want.

1265
03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:56.500
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It's more the implementation of what they want

1266
03:08:57.410 --> 03:09:02.529
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: is challenging. So, therefore, the urgency of trouble presentation is actually low.

1267
03:09:03.340 --> 03:09:25.370
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: whatever just like pick. I rather you pick one thing dive deeper than just say, this is low, this is low, this is low, as you can see, this is low. Right now. Just pick one, pick one, but for your main one, the travel planning trip, the one you prioritize each of these you need to be. You need about all 3.

1268
03:09:26.400 --> 03:09:27.420
Huanhuan Yue: Be specific.

1269
03:09:28.200 --> 03:09:29.280
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, make sense to you.

1270
03:09:29.960 --> 03:09:40.049
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yes, actually. So, so it's main like, it's okay to not go over the less urgent one. But if you do want to go into it, you want to be more specific and understand us to explain why?

1271
03:09:40.050 --> 03:09:40.670
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah.

1272
03:09:40.800 --> 03:09:46.070
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: yeah, it's okay not to say it's it. Then you can say as whenever you don't go into it, you say.

1273
03:09:46.070 --> 03:09:46.500
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: thank you.

1274
03:09:46.500 --> 03:09:54.289
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: As you can see in this table, we prioritize tree planning was because, as you can see on the table.

1275
03:09:54.640 --> 03:10:01.889
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: travel, presentation on these in general, that pretty low you can just use, as you can see on the table. They're pretty low

1276
03:10:02.040 --> 03:10:08.029
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and and and then usually to be safe. If I present, I'm going to present the winner

1277
03:10:08.190 --> 03:10:15.190
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: for all 3, but for the second best for the middle one. I want to pick one thing of the middle one

1278
03:10:15.400 --> 03:10:19.430
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: to dive deeper, to show that as example, this is

1279
03:10:19.620 --> 03:10:22.810
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: good but not as good. Just one thing.

1280
03:10:22.980 --> 03:10:27.530
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Pick one thing in urgent. This is pretty good in the pain level, so the more piece it's meaning.

1281
03:10:27.690 --> 03:10:32.430
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But the main thing is, urgency is quite medium.

1282
03:10:32.620 --> 03:10:34.609
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It was because da-da-da-da-da.

1283
03:10:34.990 --> 03:10:41.140
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: okay? And then you can see trouble. Presentation. Relative speaking is the lowest amount on the map. Then move on.

1284
03:10:43.870 --> 03:10:48.959
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, that's what we need to do. Okay, cool. And anybody clear regarding presentation. Okay? Chung question.

1285
03:10:50.161 --> 03:10:53.950
Tung Vu: It's not. Oh, actually, yeah, it's about presentation. So

1286
03:10:54.060 --> 03:11:05.889
Tung Vu: as we present the pain point and solution, you mentioned that. Can you give us example of how to tie it back to the Company Mission, the goal and the prompt goal like pro goal. Just like.

1287
03:11:06.430 --> 03:11:07.519
Tung Vu: I'll give us some.

1288
03:11:07.740 --> 03:11:08.659
Tung Vu: Okay example on that.

1289
03:11:08.660 --> 03:11:20.180
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Me. Give me the show. Me the scroll down to show me the solution side. Yeah. Solution. Okay, cool. Cool. Okay. Cool. Now. Here is the mission, the mission of the companies that we where it come up is.

1290
03:11:21.040 --> 03:11:22.479
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and they shouldn't go in the beginning.

1291
03:11:23.370 --> 03:11:25.499
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Usually during prioritization.

1292
03:11:26.600 --> 03:11:28.300
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: If you have a tie.

1293
03:11:29.280 --> 03:11:30.570
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You need to use it.

1294
03:11:32.290 --> 03:11:38.820
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: If you don't have a tie. It's a clear winner. To be frank, I think the Asian is a clear winner.

1295
03:11:39.520 --> 03:11:43.150
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: If a clear winner, you don't need to type back because a clear winner.

1296
03:11:43.710 --> 03:11:52.330
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Right? Let's say it tied with AI for the trip. Let's assume it doesn't tie right? Let's say it tied up right

1297
03:11:52.690 --> 03:11:57.370
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: in that situation the way you tie. Let's say you tie close enough.

1298
03:11:57.970 --> 03:12:01.110
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You can describe this way. So, for example, like

1299
03:12:01.570 --> 03:12:13.250
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: a agent. And Chatbot was, I prioritize this one was because the the 4 key factors, effectiveness, engineering effort, easily implementation, risk. What does mean is effectiveness.

1300
03:12:13.360 --> 03:12:19.800
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: How great the solution is able to solve the specific pain point in terms of trip planning

1301
03:12:20.380 --> 03:12:23.580
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: engineering effort, how much engineering teams ever

1302
03:12:23.760 --> 03:12:25.879
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you need to put in to develop this

1303
03:12:26.060 --> 03:12:47.070
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: implementation, how easy for end user to adopt and implement this new technology and the risk or potential risk involved. And here, because AI Chatbot could potentially. I put the risk pretty low in this in this in this score, as you can see in this table, was because it might hallucinate. And what if it hallucinate and book you from

1304
03:12:47.350 --> 03:13:02.120
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: wrong destination? That's a big disaster. Okay? And probably want to shut down the whole program. And then, in contrast, we also have the other solution, which is also pretty good

1305
03:13:02.540 --> 03:13:21.270
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: moonshot using AI for the trip, so they can pre-visualize. What's it look like before you even go there. Your entire plan trip plan is presented in front of you. So you can have a like a trailer to movie preview of your movie before you walk into movie to your final vacation destination. How fun it could be.

1306
03:13:21.690 --> 03:13:26.990
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And you can see on this table. And we'll say that again you can. You can see in the table is

1307
03:13:27.180 --> 03:13:33.710
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: it's a very good effectiveness, pretty low, whatever low or high, whatever

1308
03:13:33.880 --> 03:13:38.130
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: all of these, and at the same time.

1309
03:13:38.350 --> 03:13:44.550
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I also believe that for for, as we can see, the case which is for the purpose, better

1310
03:13:44.720 --> 03:13:54.910
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: user experience for the travel app and also was closing people together would make people feel like they're close together using tools.

1311
03:13:56.690 --> 03:14:03.399
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I feel like AR is making people less connected because you're living in your own world

1312
03:14:03.680 --> 03:14:31.889
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: instead direct, connecting people with more conversation going to trip togethers. Therefore, I still think overall AI. Agent plus Chatbot, has the highest score, not only have best effectiveness, implementation, okay, risk and also meeting with the goal much better. As example, I will say it that way. But I made up in terms of AR making people separate. I made up stuff. Okay?

1313
03:14:34.750 --> 03:14:39.590
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: because I don't think that making people separate it just just not as effective.

1314
03:14:40.170 --> 03:14:40.920
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Perfect.

1315
03:14:42.037 --> 03:14:45.589
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: That's example, how you link it back

1316
03:14:46.840 --> 03:14:50.560
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: to the mission. When you have a tie.

1317
03:14:51.950 --> 03:14:54.600
Tung Vu: Hmm, but there is no need.

1318
03:14:54.970 --> 03:15:02.429
Tung Vu: Actually, yeah, it makes sense. And basically, there is no need to immediately mention it. I just want to kind of like. See if there is a way to

1319
03:15:02.600 --> 03:15:07.440
Tung Vu: kind of like. Make sure that you, you know, once you mentioned solution, it ties all the way back. So.

1320
03:15:07.810 --> 03:15:08.330
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah.

1321
03:15:08.330 --> 03:15:16.600
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you just yeah, you type out the way I described basically say, I'm pretty good. But Asian Chatbot is.

1322
03:15:16.870 --> 03:15:28.440
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: this is created, have a better experience, and also making people closer together by enabling

1323
03:15:29.220 --> 03:15:39.549
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: group travels, the planning with whole community together, so encourage people to travel even more, basically add it back that way.

1324
03:15:42.320 --> 03:15:48.050
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah. But for clear winners it's not necessary. When you have a tie you need to. You need link back

1325
03:15:49.230 --> 03:15:53.280
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: or or close time right.

1326
03:15:54.450 --> 03:15:54.770
Tung Vu: Good.

1327
03:15:54.770 --> 03:16:00.349
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Because the personal travel agent right? Clearly, you don't use human right? Clearly.

1328
03:16:00.460 --> 03:16:13.150
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: also, obvious choice, because this one is so obvious, we don't really need to link it back when you have like on the fence is close enough. That's why we'll create this clean back, the mission better. And also the purposes.

1329
03:16:13.150 --> 03:16:17.079
Tung Vu: If it's not mission, then we still need to mention the product goal right? And so.

1330
03:16:17.360 --> 03:16:18.560
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: That is, yeah.

1331
03:16:18.740 --> 03:16:21.849
Tung Vu: Yeah, so that means it's better experience in protocol. Okay.

1332
03:16:22.555 --> 03:16:27.140
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, which is ex, yeah, go back to the

1333
03:16:27.400 --> 03:16:34.359
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: this is clearly better experience. Human I think you have obvious choice. But you can say it

1334
03:16:34.720 --> 03:16:41.510
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: clearly. Better experience in in terms of protocol, this AI Asian Chatbots. They're very experienced in human. And the

1335
03:16:43.190 --> 03:16:48.340
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and AR, yeah, cool.

1336
03:16:50.830 --> 03:16:56.150
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Cool. I like this. Okay, the one thing in the senior Pm. Team there is a little bit confusion.

1337
03:16:56.820 --> 03:17:02.109
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Well, after you prioritize a pain point, the 3 solutions should be solving the same pain. Point

1338
03:17:02.680 --> 03:17:09.139
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: not 3 solutions. Solving multiple pain points. It will only choose one pain point. The reason is.

1339
03:17:09.360 --> 03:17:14.729
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: ta take notes. The reason is it's 45 min.

1340
03:17:15.420 --> 03:17:17.790
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I'd rather you go deeper.

1341
03:17:19.220 --> 03:17:27.470
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Then do something. 3 solutions solving 3 pain points. And and what if number 3 is not as good. And also that's what the interviewer want to see.

1342
03:17:27.570 --> 03:17:38.650
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: We have limited time initial. Then you prioritize. I prioritize this pain point. Let me show you 3 different ways to solve the same pain point, and also show you which of the 3 can can be the best

1343
03:17:39.420 --> 03:17:42.539
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: after evaluating the 4 different kind of trade-offs.

1344
03:17:43.750 --> 03:17:54.420
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, do not do 3 solutions solving 3 pain point, or whatever many different pain points. It's not what the interview want to see. When you have limited time.

1345
03:17:55.960 --> 03:18:04.660
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: We have 2 h, 5 h. Yeah, you can have many or even several days. You can create so many solutions solving all possible pain point. You can do that.

1346
03:18:05.550 --> 03:18:08.470
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I bet this is 45 min case. You can do it fast.

1347
03:18:08.640 --> 03:18:10.099
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Trump question.

1348
03:18:11.072 --> 03:18:25.959
Tung Vu: On the basically the solutions. Or even when we are talking about the pain points. Actually, yeah. So for solutions, the the prompt is design, a travel app right? But the solution is, feels like a feature of an app.

1349
03:18:26.060 --> 03:18:45.790
Tung Vu: So how to make sure that we are not kind of like we, we stay in focus, we talking about 1 1 part of the app or basically main point main feature of the app. But the app also consists of a lot of other stuff. So in the in in the interview, what what do the interviews expect when you, when they ask you to design an app.

1350
03:18:46.450 --> 03:18:47.560
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, so.

1351
03:18:47.560 --> 03:18:48.720
Tung Vu: Scope might be big, so.

1352
03:18:48.850 --> 03:18:52.709
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So the next part, which is, go to Mep phase.

1353
03:18:53.520 --> 03:18:59.630
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: what have the solution? The interviewer will say, okay, so can you draw out.

1354
03:18:59.880 --> 03:19:00.430
Tung Vu: Yeah.

1355
03:19:00.560 --> 03:19:02.529
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: The AI agent travel app for me.

1356
03:19:02.900 --> 03:19:07.959
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: That's where the the app, because app, as you said, app has multiple things.

1357
03:19:08.150 --> 03:19:11.610
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: More than this is the main feature, this the most. This is like

1358
03:19:11.810 --> 03:19:19.779
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: differentiated feature for your app. But App has multiple different things, right? So that's with with Mvp face, Mvp face basically has.

1359
03:19:20.210 --> 03:19:23.780
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: There's a screen, something talking, I assume.

1360
03:19:24.410 --> 03:19:27.589
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I think it's I think the Chatbot pop up.

1361
03:19:27.780 --> 03:19:43.459
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And then something that back end booked and your app will have confirmation. It's booked, booked, booked, booked, booked. Your itinerary is here. You already. See the email confirmation. And I already know the confirmation like this is in your email is also here regarding you fly to Dubai tomorrow.

1362
03:19:43.640 --> 03:19:52.419
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Some say so that the app the app has multiple user experience. Would you describe the key feature of those user experience. But it's in the Mvp phase.

1363
03:19:55.250 --> 03:20:03.459
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, because the final step we should have the solutions into result. Can you draw the Mvp. For me? What's what's your AI travel agent and plus Chatbot look like.

1364
03:20:05.900 --> 03:20:12.030
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And then you do what I described. You have multiple screens putting a paper piece of paper, do it fast.

1365
03:20:12.400 --> 03:20:15.500
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: The screams Chatbot and back and forth

1366
03:20:15.660 --> 03:20:20.550
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: book book notification or something whatever.

1367
03:20:21.870 --> 03:20:25.040
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, cool. Jenna, question.

1368
03:20:25.250 --> 03:20:39.960
Jana Jiang: So for Facebook interview, they have their own whiteboard, you gonna write during the interview. So for Mvp, you're suggesting we write on the their own whiteboard, or just on our PC. Because it's faster.

1369
03:20:40.320 --> 03:20:42.400
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I suggest on a piece of paper

1370
03:20:42.530 --> 03:20:50.559
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: as faster. We. I think I've been working with others before, very slow when you do it. When do a whiteboard.

1371
03:20:50.560 --> 03:20:51.810
Jana Jiang: In the same section.

1372
03:20:51.810 --> 03:21:05.309
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Think, think about. Think about this. What I described has those check marks and booked booked, booked notification back and forth like, like, right? So I think it's faster using hands. But I will make it clear to interview, saying

1373
03:21:05.730 --> 03:21:16.240
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: it's much faster if I do it on a piece of paper to show you what what app look like. Do you mind doing a piece of paper faster than I shown in the screen? It's okay.

1374
03:21:17.150 --> 03:21:18.970
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: He will say, okay.

1375
03:21:19.300 --> 03:21:20.539
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And then you do it.

1376
03:21:20.930 --> 03:21:23.109
Jana Jiang: It's very slow on the on the screen.

1377
03:21:25.650 --> 03:21:39.059
Jana Jiang: Think so too. So also, before the Mvp. Do we need to go over everything as a separate to make it clear, like, basically summarize everything all the steps. Or we just.

1378
03:21:39.290 --> 03:21:40.849
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It's not consulting interview.

1379
03:21:42.370 --> 03:21:53.399
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: No, you don't need to. It. Just that it describes solutions. Is that okay? Join Mvp. What the solution look like, join out loud, and they just join and then tell them what's look like. Oh, oh, just remind me one thing.

1380
03:21:54.120 --> 03:21:55.269
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Go all the way up.

1381
03:21:56.045 --> 03:21:56.820
Huanhuan Yue: Okay.

1382
03:21:56.820 --> 03:21:58.110
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: All the way up, very up.

1383
03:21:58.510 --> 03:21:58.970
Huanhuan Yue: Simple.

1384
03:21:58.970 --> 03:22:09.100
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You should, I forgot, mentioned in the beginning. You should tell them your framework up front. Comprehensive situation. So you tell the framework, after comprehensive situation.

1385
03:22:09.766 --> 03:22:19.120
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Go here on the CTA. Scroll who who is controlling the screen? Yeah. on between C and I, towards the end of C

1386
03:22:20.610 --> 03:22:34.150
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: towards the end of C towards the end of C doing C, and I, oh, yeah, yeah, okay, so yeah, tell them the framework right here. So basically, you clarify you told them assumptions, different things. Then you say, Okay, what I'm going to do next is

1387
03:22:35.140 --> 03:22:37.760
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I'm going to break down customer segmentation.

1388
03:22:38.470 --> 03:22:48.390
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: do some quick prioritization and show different pain point and then create different solutions and evaluate trade-off for solutions.

1389
03:22:49.410 --> 03:22:50.620
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Is it okay?

1390
03:22:51.770 --> 03:22:54.609
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Give them a high level. What the framework look like

1391
03:22:55.020 --> 03:22:58.849
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: they will say, Okay, okay, go ahead and then say, Okay, cool.

1392
03:22:59.040 --> 03:23:02.110
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Can have 30 seconds thinking about customer segmentation

1393
03:23:03.500 --> 03:23:09.219
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and say, Oh, yes. So just feel free to ask time. You should always ask

1394
03:23:09.400 --> 03:23:11.820
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: time in between each steps.

1395
03:23:12.090 --> 03:23:30.090
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So you have a guaranteed success instead of you. Think on the fly will never give you great answer. Just ask for time. Can think about like for 70 seconds. Just always ask until you take notes. We're going to always ask for 30 seconds or 1 min in between each steps.

1396
03:23:34.198 --> 03:23:38.669
Mun Chet: Is this the part? You say it in the beginning, or like at the end.

1397
03:23:39.320 --> 03:23:40.390
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: 30 seconds.

1398
03:23:40.840 --> 03:23:44.939
Mun Chet: Oh, sorry like you explain your framework like how you, coming up with these.

1399
03:23:47.570 --> 03:23:48.870
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, like this!

1400
03:23:48.870 --> 03:23:50.010
Mun Chet: Circle. Yeah.

1401
03:23:50.200 --> 03:23:54.579
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: The we talk about. The framework is at the end of C part

1402
03:23:56.080 --> 03:23:57.960
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: as in A. C. Before I.

1403
03:23:58.880 --> 03:23:59.720
Mun Chet: Thank you.

1404
03:24:00.540 --> 03:24:08.729
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Cool. All right. So let me can you? Whoever control the screen? Please stop sharing. Let me do the Q. And A. Quickly

1405
03:24:08.910 --> 03:24:17.419
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Lemia, throw that away, am I? Am I sharing something weird?

1406
03:24:17.640 --> 03:24:18.650
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay?

1407
03:24:20.005 --> 03:24:25.940
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Put your questions in the Slido. Let me go here, Slider, Srido.

1408
03:24:38.590 --> 03:24:41.880
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Alright straddle.

1409
03:24:42.930 --> 03:24:48.149
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So Cerrado is what Marla shared here. You can submit questions.

1410
03:24:51.600 --> 03:24:52.960
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Is there any questions?

1411
03:24:53.720 --> 03:24:55.289
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: No questions? Okay? Fine.

1412
03:24:56.880 --> 03:25:01.890
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay. Basically. That's where you submit questions, looks like, answer all the questions can I ask.

1413
03:25:01.890 --> 03:25:03.290
Sisi Zhong: Question here.

1414
03:25:03.686 --> 03:25:05.270
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah. Go ahead. CC.

1415
03:25:05.270 --> 03:25:26.919
Sisi Zhong: Sorry. This is my 1st time attending the session, so I'm not sure you may have covered another session as we go through this case study. Is it best to come out with everything before we present? Or should we present a section and then to your point, ask for time to think about the response for the next section for each of the step here.

1416
03:25:27.120 --> 03:25:31.969
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Second one ta take notes, basically

1417
03:25:32.190 --> 03:25:51.779
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: go through each steps, but tell them you have all the steps of what we showed to see. Session. 1st comprehend situation, tell all the assumptions, make sure we set the right goal correctly and then tell, okay, I'm gonna do the following step identify customers, customer segmentation, pain, point solutioning. And then

1418
03:25:52.040 --> 03:25:53.080
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you

1419
03:25:54.000 --> 03:26:01.179
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: go through each of steps and ask for 30 seconds before each step, so that you brainstorm ideas for that step.

1420
03:26:03.440 --> 03:26:09.139
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and then you go through the step and brainstorm another 30 seconds or 1 min for the steps, and do a next step.

1421
03:26:11.860 --> 03:26:12.330
Sisi Zhong: Okay.

1422
03:26:13.600 --> 03:26:14.320
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Hmm.

1423
03:26:17.600 --> 03:26:20.310
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: cool. Okay. Great. Cool.

1424
03:26:20.310 --> 03:26:20.870
Nick Myrtle: See.

1425
03:26:21.260 --> 03:26:21.850
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: A.

1426
03:26:22.290 --> 03:26:30.889
Nick Myrtle: Sorry. I just had a Hi. How you doing? I'm I'm sorry. I just had a quick question, and I wasn't sure if it's allowed to be asked now if I should ask in an office hours elsewhere.

1427
03:26:31.459 --> 03:26:59.940
Nick Myrtle: It was just in regards to what you mentioned about the product portfolio that I was putting together. And I'm gonna reach out. I saw your message on discord to the alumni who packaged her fitness programs and and made that a product for a product portfolio. Yeah, the the main thing I'm having a tough time with is just that. There's quite a few different industries that interest me, and I know that you said that it's best to integrate AI into the product portfolio so that you appeal to a lot of other ones.

1428
03:27:00.150 --> 03:27:00.360
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Bye.

1429
03:27:00.360 --> 03:27:13.130
Nick Myrtle: I'm just trying to think of a good way to have like my signature product. But then have 2 other products that can help with being exposed to a few other different industries, such as, for example, Ecom or

1430
03:27:14.024 --> 03:27:24.139
Nick Myrtle: Fintech, or Ed tech, and those sort of things without, you know, putting a signature product out there, and that just narrows my opportunities elsewhere. Does that make sense.

1431
03:27:24.487 --> 03:27:36.649
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Then you can have 2 links to portfolio. So maybe you can create multiple ones. Let's say, apply for e-commerce company. You move the that e-commerce signature product as a top one at the signature.

1432
03:27:36.650 --> 03:27:40.430
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, you change your signature product based on the type of company you present. You apply for.

1433
03:27:40.430 --> 03:27:43.300
Nick Myrtle: Okay, gotcha gotcha, and I'll probably just then do 3.

1434
03:27:43.440 --> 03:27:56.239
Nick Myrtle: I'll go into detail for all 3 of them, and just have one. That's like sort of like health based one that's more based on like Fintech. And, for example, one that's more based on like Ecom. And then that can target. When I do applications that way.

1435
03:27:56.240 --> 03:27:59.869
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, exactly. And then you can make the rest as other portfolio.

1436
03:28:00.290 --> 03:28:11.580
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But the ones the main one. You just you rotate, you rotate whatever you apply, you make a signature part. You make it very clear. The signature part I must click here. The rest is other. If you'd like to check. That's it.

1437
03:28:12.200 --> 03:28:21.769
Nick Myrtle: Gotcha gotcha, so I'll just put that in the application. Be like, here's the 3. But please click on this one as my signature one for for this interview. Okay, beautiful. That was the main thing. Thank you, Dr. Nancy.

1438
03:28:21.980 --> 03:28:28.110
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: No, no, no wrong wrong one. URL. The URL homepage home page has.

1439
03:28:28.600 --> 03:28:29.840
Nick Myrtle: Yeah, your face?

1440
03:28:30.380 --> 03:28:36.570
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, whatever you have. And then you said, this is my second niche product. Click here

1441
03:28:37.140 --> 03:28:45.829
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: one URL, and then you can still have others other product portfolio down below other examples. That's it. One, URL.

1442
03:28:46.180 --> 03:28:47.759
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You don't send them 3 Urls.

1443
03:28:48.369 --> 03:28:48.980
Nick Myrtle: If

1444
03:28:49.420 --> 03:28:57.220
Nick Myrtle: yes, yes. So I've got the one URL for a Wix website. But if I, if I applied it, say 3 different companies at the same time that are in 3 different industries.

1445
03:28:57.220 --> 03:29:02.949
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, oh! You give us 3 URL, but only give! Give us 3 different Urls by one URL

1446
03:29:03.140 --> 03:29:04.040
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: for each.

1447
03:29:04.390 --> 03:29:08.090
Nick Myrtle: I, just for each company, give them 3 different ones.

1448
03:29:08.090 --> 03:29:09.200
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1449
03:29:09.200 --> 03:29:11.849
Nick Myrtle: Yeah. Okay. Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay. Thank you for that.

1450
03:29:11.850 --> 03:29:13.740
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: No problem, tron question.

1451
03:29:14.463 --> 03:29:22.069
Tung Vu: You kept mentioning about the table like showing the table. But I was thinking, if I'm writing down everything on the paper, then do I show it on camera.

1452
03:29:22.470 --> 03:29:23.010
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yes.

1453
03:29:23.350 --> 03:29:24.030
Tung Vu: Okay, because.

1454
03:29:24.030 --> 03:29:26.059
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Turn on table. You you do. You do this one.

1455
03:29:26.060 --> 03:29:34.750
Tung Vu: Okay, okay, because you like. In the presentation, like, we keep saying, Oh, as you can see in the table. But then you have to. You know the focus, and then you have to show it.

1456
03:29:34.750 --> 03:29:35.139
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You do it?

1457
03:29:35.140 --> 03:29:36.760
Tung Vu: Might be okay. Alright.

1458
03:29:36.760 --> 03:29:42.289
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: As you can see in table. You you do it on the table, and I've seen people

1459
03:29:42.690 --> 03:29:53.790
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: sorry. Back and forth. You can do the whiteboard for the for the table, and then when you draw Mvp. You must do a paper. It's just much faster.

1460
03:29:53.790 --> 03:29:54.819
Tung Vu: Alright, alright, cool.

1461
03:29:54.820 --> 03:29:56.559
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Swish back and forth.

1462
03:30:00.070 --> 03:30:18.679
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: okay, cool. All right. So answer all the questions. We'll see you on Tuesday for my office hours. Okay, if you guys have any other questions just payment talk or go to our coaches in different office hours every single day. There's my office hours. Okay, cool, cool. All right. Talk guys soon see you on Tuesday for myself.

1463
