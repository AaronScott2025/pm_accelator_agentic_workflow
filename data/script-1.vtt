4
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:32.279
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And, cinta, this weekend's long weekend. I choose not to take a break myself. I don't sure. I'm not sure if students are taking break or not. But anyway, so thank you for making the determination. But if you guys want to take break during the long weekend?

5
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.429
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You need to let me know, because I decide not to take a break.

6
00:01:37.368 --> 00:01:47.130
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But if you want to take a break. I'm more than happy to take a break as well. Okay. So once you guys let me know. At same time, let me remove am. Turn off your AI before you come in

7
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:58.020
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: let me remove the one. Sec.

8
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:14.540
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Hmm.

9
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.730
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I sent in the wrong place.

10
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.870
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Mine. Huh!

11
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.070
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: How can I move AI to a different?

12
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.080
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Let me remove AI. Then we can get started.

13
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.119
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It makes you turn it off before you come in.

14
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.280
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, cool. Okay, welcome, everybody. So let's get started with module. 2 training

15
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.149
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: let me share my screen.

16
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.640
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: How's everybody's weekend?

17
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.730
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, no.

18
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.559
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I caption share my slides.

19
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:43.570
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Cool. Okay, great alright. So everybody, let's get started. Let me share my slides here.

20
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:57.109
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: All right. So today we are going to go through how to sell self module. 2. And anybody who is new do not get worried or scared. How come we start from module? 2, not from module, one. Okay. So now.

21
00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.640
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: being on with training each week

22
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:28.180
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: is independent of each other, each module independent of each other. So you don't need to study module, one which resume before you study module 2. How to sell yourself. So each module is very independent of each other. Something. Pm. They start from module a first, st so each one is different. So usually, when you come in to do nuisance, I will tell you which one to get started first.st Okay. So now, without further ado, let's dive into today's important module and module. 2 used to be behavior interview. And I change the title to be how to sell yourself. Okay.

23
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.490
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: the important ships really represent the purpose of behavior interview.

24
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.220
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It is not about.

25
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:51.249
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: hey? What happened? Most of you guys made the wrong assumption. People ask. You tell me time we have conflict. Tell me time when you manage stakeholder conflict any of those questions. It's not about exactly what happened. It is about

26
00:04:51.800 --> 00:05:05.739
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: what should have happened, how you organize the answers that give the hiring manager want to hear, and then it's going to sell yourself and then a job offer. Okay, so now, today. Let's dive into how to answer the question. 1st of all.

27
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.990
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: go to celebration channel.

28
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:14.800
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So exciting. We got another Meta offer. This is exciting, super super exciting. It's like crazy. Okay, I know

29
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.620
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: this week, Meta announced

30
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:29.450
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: layoff people. But I still have, I think, 4 students actively interviewing with Meta. Another 4 students actively interviewing with Google right now. So it's a lot going on. Yes, layout happens.

31
00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.800
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But it's a sign of them reorganizing the company and making more efficient.

32
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:58.950
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay. As I said, they're still hiring people working for the same company in the same time they're laying out people. It's just a way for them to reshift the focus of the company, and also bring in the best candidate and to be friends. Sometimes when they are people, they are people who get high, they get paid the highest, but contribute the least return investment. So therefore, I want you guys go to celebration channel. We also have other people landing Aipm job offer

33
00:05:59.247 --> 00:06:10.332
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: or, as I mentioned, and other people, and if, like a matter of job offer as well. So there's a lot going on in the job market. Right now, I want you guys focus on your strategies and implement your

34
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:40.570
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: your specific like feedback that we teach you in the class so that you can achieve your result very quickly as well. And and as you know, we implement lots of new changes every single day except Friday. We have office hours. We have training every single day. So whenever you're stuck or you have interview coming up, feel free to come in to have my coaches and myself and help you prepare for your upcoming interviews. Okay, cool now. Oh, let me tell you. Give me one second. I need some water, one sec. Run on water. One sec.

35
00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.749
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: 30 seconds. Let me refill my.

36
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.460
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: okay, cool.

37
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:40.590
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Let's continue. Okay. So I love to share the story. And actually, Michael Jordan's story is a favorite story, and all my students have listened in the past and asked them, Hey, which one do you like the most? They said. Module 2. Michael Jordan story.

38
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:53.100
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: All right. So let me tell you 2 main stories. Each time I teach live. I try to inspire all of you guys, and I believe is part of the important training methodology. We implement, you guys because the job market is very competitive right now. So you need to have very

39
00:07:53.710 --> 00:08:03.060
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: tough mindset to go through the complications in the job market. So that's why I love to inspire you. And this is another behind scenes story. So it's amazing. Michael Jordan story. Okay.

40
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:09.859
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: we know. Oh, we all know him, Michael Jordan. Right? So one of the most famous

41
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:12.270
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: basketball player out there.

42
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:32.300
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: He won like awards here and there, all throughout his entire career, and, as you know, for famous people like him, he was interviewed on many different kind of like sports. Channel espn any other channels out there, and people frequently asked him, what kind of secret behind your success

43
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.499
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: can you imagine what he said? He said.

44
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:40.430
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: People pretty rewarded for what

45
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:45.669
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: other people are not seeing you. The effort you put in when other people are not seeing you.

46
00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.279
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you're being awarded in public, but in reality. You're rewarded for

47
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.460
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: the effort you put in when people are not seeing you.

48
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.340
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay.

49
00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.130
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So what he meant was, he said.

50
00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:10.190
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You guys see me like being very successful, winning any kind of like Nba championship. But do you know that what it takes for me to get here?

51
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.620
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: He said. In the past 10 years. He literally wake up

52
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.210
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: every single day at 5 A. M.

53
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:32.080
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Then he's doing going to shoot the ball. The 3 Points ball from very, very far away from basketball hoop, so he gonna shoot it for 1,500 times every single day, every single morning at 5 am. For 10 years straight.

54
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:42.430
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: If you count on all the balls together, it's like millions of balls. Just practice practice every single day. Right? And what what makes it even even more interesting. He's saying that it's a team sports

55
00:09:43.290 --> 00:10:00.139
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: every time when his team members, lots of young team members, they love to go out party until 2 am. So yeah, sometimes we go out. But at 5 Am. Not only he will wake up. He's also going to wake up his team members as well, saying, you know what it's time to play team sports as well. I practice you guys practice as well.

56
00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:30.290
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: People always always talk about. Oh, on the surface. Oh, yeah, you join Meta. So this week we just have another student and Meta offer a few weeks before we have another one also join Meta as well, so it's not about. Oh, yeah. People always talk about your success in front of public. But you in reality, you're rewarded for the effort you put in. But people frequently do not talk about the reality of the effort you put in behind the scenes, or because lots of time people do not want to listen

57
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.819
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: was it was the truth? Was the reality.

58
00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:38.830
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay? And so therefore I want you guys also put in the behind scenes effort

59
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:46.870
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: for sexual people like Michael Jordan, and he literally said, There's lots of people also very tall, was like born with gift.

60
00:10:47.010 --> 00:11:01.679
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: being able to play basketball better than other people around faster in many different ways could be better than him. But he said, because he put in more effort than other people to secure his space, not just say one time in championship, secure his space, become the

61
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:23.999
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: best, like basketball player in the history. That's why he wake up at 5 Am. Every single day do 1,500 like practice shoot every single morning. Okay, so how is reflection to all of you guys? Study the program? I'm not asking you to get at 5 Am. But I do have students get a 5 Am. You know who they are.

62
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:53.609
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Nicholas, and he's from Andrea. So both of them are Brazilian. The reason they get up so early was like they're literally like paying us dollar. But for Brazilian salary, so let's say, they're paying like 25% of annual salary for Pma like crazy. So they were like, you know what, Nancy, I really really need to get the best out of the program I have studied every single word you talk about. So they both of them just work together. Hey, let's all both get up at 5 Am. Study Dr. Nancy material. So right now, Nicholas.

63
00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:59.029
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: in his family, literally immigrated from Brazil to London

64
00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:15.900
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and Andrea today he's working for, like, I think, Pfizer, one of the largest pharmaceutical company in the Us. Right now. So now again, I'm not asking you to get if I am. I want you to understand what other people put in the effort behind seeing story.

65
00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:38.730
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: If you ask any of my students who joined fan companies today, ask them, how hard did they study? Many of them go to the celebration channel. Many of them wrote and said, Hey, even Jenny WAN recently joined Meta. She said same thing in her celebration advice to Alumni Channel, said, Hey, I study many modules, many cases, listen to many cases, many, many times, because each time we listen to the same case

66
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:44.949
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I learned something new, I was able to digest it and understand the concept into a different level.

67
00:12:45.160 --> 00:13:09.880
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: She's already a Pm. She want to join Meta. She studied really build solid foundations. Okay, so I want all of you guys also said, you will study goals, study, pass as well for people who is currently preparing for fan interview module. 5. I lay out exactly how to prepare for our cases and for people not going for Fan Pass. You need to do at least 20 cases, the bare minimum to even manage up.

68
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:23.799
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay. So therefore, I want you guys to put in the effort whatever let's say, your networking script was not good, or you are not able to master all the key concepts we teach. You feel free to come here for our coaches. Help, you guys. As I said every single day except Friday.

69
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:32.791
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: We don't have teaching time every single day. We are teaching you guys, you said Friday, okay, we're here to fully support you, but I want you to put in the effort. So now

70
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:52.330
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: The picture in the middle of the screen is another student of mine who joined Amazon. I want you to show you how she put in the effort again. It's not based on. Do you get up early or not? I just want to show you how other people prepare, use material so that you can achieve same success as well. Okay, this is.

71
00:13:52.390 --> 00:14:07.629
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: if you go to my homepage website, you can see different kind of testimonial. Muyang was one person like my early students. She joined Amazon, her background. She was working. She got a Phd. In informatics and then working for hospital for 6 years in Tampa.

72
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:28.539
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Florida. And then she learned a job from Amazon and moved the entire family to Seattle and let's rebreak into Pm. And the 1st job she broke into Pm. Is also Amazon in fan company, and then, when she reached out to me. She told me that. Hey, Nancy, I'm okay. It takes really long time to break into Fan, but I only want to join a fan company. Tell me exactly what I should do and what I can do.

73
00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:42.320
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay? And then I told her some story. Here's how to prepare different things and let me show you how she prepared for her fan interview given she never at the time, she never worked in product before, and she was in healthcare. She want to break into fan. Okay, so this is her preparation.

74
00:14:42.350 --> 00:15:00.440
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: If you are preparing for Amazon interview, I said it multiple times. You need to prepare and get ready and create 30 different stories because there are 14 principles. You have 2 stories per principle that equals to 13. Okay, that's easily hit up the number very quickly. Okay, so what does this mean? Once you have the 13 different principles.

75
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:14.330
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And so these stories she literally wrote down the keywords and high thought process for each of principle. Can you can you see this on her sheet right here? Each of key principles was breakdown, and then see her entire folder.

76
00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:30.619
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: The folder has multiple pages. There's a thick folder of her entire preparation, with all the notes, all the like keywords of her answers. That's how she prepare and get ready for very comprehensive like interview for those like fan companies.

77
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:39.550
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And the 1st Pm. Job, she learned, was already in fan companies. This actually also happened to many, many of my students as well. Okay, that's the behind the scenes that I want to share with you today and

78
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:40.860
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: again

79
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:53.020
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: feel free to design your own specific effort and study plan, and we're here to help you out. And another very important thing is in the onboarding sheet. All my

80
00:15:54.070 --> 00:16:22.440
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: in the onboard hashtag onboarding channel. And also when you join the program, my team also send you onboarding link, which is Pmsr slash onboarding. It's the same link. Okay? And when you click the link in this one session session 5, which has week by week breakdown regarding what you need to study every single week, I plan it out for you guys as well, please study those and follow through. Okay. So now, without further ado, okay, I'm going to skip on a Schwarzenegger.

81
00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:40.349
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: inspiring stories because I talk so much inspiring, you guys. But I highly recommend all of you guys instead of watching random Netflix videos, watch Arnold Schwarzenegger's how to describe his bio, his life. There's a video about his life.

82
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:42.730
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Do you cut a bio? I don't know.

83
00:16:42.940 --> 00:17:11.790
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It's a documentary. It's a documentary about Arnold Schwarzenegger. Please watch those, and you will understand lots of like limiting ideas. You think you cannot do after you watch that you feel like. Yes, you can definitely push through. And whatever obstacles you see right now, maybe this little. And after you watch this, it becomes like almost very small. Okay, cool. And now also let me let me highlight the differences between implementing strategy. Okay.

84
00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:32.750
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: same classmate. And Amy spoke about our alumni fam alumni panel years ago and feel free to go back to see her alumni panel. Both of my students are real students. One is Amy, the other one Amy's students. For Amy's student. I hide her identity because I don't want to talk bad about other people. But Amy 3 or 4, you know who they are. Okay. So now.

85
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:38.870
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: both of them same background. But the implement strategy completely different. Okay, Amy's classmate

86
00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:46.829
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: commit science students commit science internship and no experience. And she went to one of the schools in Ohio, like literally, nobody heard of

87
00:17:47.490 --> 00:18:04.669
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Amy's classmate same experience, but she went to way. Better school. She went to Duke University, and both of them are high school classmates. They know each other for a very, very long time. They even do mock interview together. Okay, well, the outcome. Amy went to the same program, and she, her 1st

88
00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:08.679
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: job outside of college, is Microsoft, prime manager, Job.

89
00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:29.840
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Amy's classmate. She failed all possible Pm. Interviews, you can imagine. But she learned way, more interview opportunity, because she went to better school than Amy. But she felt all Pm. Interviews, and one year later she reapply for the same company, and she decided to go to master's program because she can extend her try out more. So during the master's

90
00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:49.140
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: 1st year she applied for internship again, and then she joined Microsoft. But her entire job, like Pm. Job journey, was delayed by 2 years because she wasn't able to land her 1st Pm. Job after she got her bachelor's degree. Okay? So now those 2 students, those were 2 young girls have the exact, the same background.

91
00:18:49.540 --> 00:19:09.029
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And then Amy even went to worse school than her classmate. Why her classmate does not get the same kind of result, and also delay her success for 2 years. It was because the way Amy implement the strategies. Okay, we literally teach the same kind of strategies and also same kind of support for all our students. But whenever Amy, come to me, ask me questions during office hours.

92
00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.940
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I can tell.

93
00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:14.189
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: She really worked on the feedback I gave her from

94
00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:32.800
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: last time we talked to. She literally come back, saying, Nancy, I saw what we taught me last time I implement this. I tried really hard working on this, and now I have additional new questions. Each time when we, when we have a conversation she saw really deep, she leveraged on top of each time when we discuss and grow herself

95
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:59.420
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: in contrast, Amy's classmate. So funny she looks really. Oh, Nancy, I have an interview with like Google tomorrow. Can you help me tonight? It's always like, did you study all the a modules? Did you implement the strategy? Do you make sure you do not waste opportunities or result like all those she's like? No, or even she scans through this one. She literally forgot about this, and that's the main reason she lost all the tier one companies interview.

96
00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.219
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay. So therefore, I want you guys

97
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:25.419
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: like not only study once and really think deep. Okay, how can really implement digest everything I want to like, learn today. And also each time we provide feedback implement instead of always coming at last minute, saying, I have interview questions. Interview comment was, tomorrow, Google Meta interviews Amy's classmate and land interview opportunity. And often companies somehow just wasn't able to even pass any interviews

98
00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:35.580
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: was because she always prepared last minute. It doesn't work. Okay. So implement and hope all of you guys can land any of your dream job offer as well. Okay, cool. Now

99
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:59.880
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: without further ado. Let's continue. Oh, and and yes, refer, and your friends join our program.

100
00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:09.240
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: launching a free Aipm bookcam this summer for kids from teenager teenager for low income families actually very excited about this topic. So

101
00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:32.089
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: today, I'm going to teach you 3 different framework rail framework, 3 phases, framework, and also 3 by 2 framework. Okay, they'll have different names, Grail framework. Each of the framework I filmed recording goes through all the framework. I'm not going to go through all the recordings. We'll read through the slides. But I want to spend 30 seconds. Review you those Grail framework. What does it mean? And then we implement the framework right away. Okay, what is Grail framework? Get to the point.

102
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.020
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: G.

103
00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:44.320
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: R, which means you need to spend about one sentence. Summarize. What's going on? Okay? R. Represent reasons. What's make it so important for the interviewer

104
00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:50.069
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: to pay attention to what you said in the interview. Okay? And

105
00:21:50.200 --> 00:22:04.210
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: actions one to 3 very straightforward. What action do you do? You take one to 3? But most important thing you must understand. When you say 1, 2, 3 steps. You say 1, 2, 3, or first, st second, 3rd

106
00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:11.850
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: in the interview must say it because it's easy. Get distracted when you give them bulk of information.

107
00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:28.349
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, so make it break it down. 1, 2, 3, and then you have one sentence, summary upfront and one supporting point. Okay, you have 6 sentences in total and then tell them the impact. I stand for impact 3 forward. Okay, L stands for learning again. Only one sentence, learning

108
00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:43.199
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: each of the framework. I tell you what exactly is how many sentences impact one sentence, right? The actions is 3 steps each step 2 sentence per step. So it's literally I have framework layout for you guys in the download session

109
00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:52.570
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: on Module 2. I also have the specific download. You can see all my sample answers. 21 sample answers my answer to 21 sample answers, okay.

110
00:22:52.570 --> 00:23:14.099
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: take a look and on and implement those sample answers and create your own stories as well. Okay? So I also filmed different video regarding how create many different stories, and please watch it, and then come here to the mock interviews or ask any additional questions that you are not sure how to answer. Okay, cool. Now, what I'm going to do today, the way we teach live is this like this, okay.

111
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:16.890
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: what's my timer.

112
00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:25.170
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You know, I implement new methodology. I got a time myself when I talk, and also gonna time you guys all the time with the physical timer. But the way we do it is that

113
00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:45.490
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I'm going to have each of the students answer these type of questions. For example, tell me a time we had conflict with others. Tell me a time we fell. Tell me when you reposition a product. Those are very popular interviewing questions. Okay, we're going to go through all the questions together and pick one volunteer per question.

114
00:23:46.500 --> 00:24:16.100
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So that give you a demo how to improve the answer for those questions. And any of you guys, let's say, oh, I didn't have time to do mock interviews. Document 3 about. Tell me a time when you felt feel free to come to our Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and no Friday and Saturday. Mock interviews. Okay, you have every single day we're teaching live. We'll have my coaches except Friday. Okay? So you can always, always come in to do mock interview with me or my coaches help you improve this today. I just want to use it

115
00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.259
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: at the demo.

116
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:46.079
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, so show you how to really write the answers correctly. Now, let's do this. Anybody who has your sample answer. Let me review all the questions first, st okay, each one. I need one volunteer. So we'll show you how to improve the answer, how to implement the framework. Okay, the framework is very easy. It's more about implementation. Okay, a lot of you guys think it's easy, but it's harder. Okay, so

117
00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:52.070
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: let me review all the questions. So preparing answers. For example, tell me a time we had conflict with others.

118
00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:54.040
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Tell me a time when you failed.

119
00:24:54.727 --> 00:25:02.662
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Tell me about a time when you reposition a product is mainly for Senior Pm, I only pick Senior Pm, to answer the question. Okay,

120
00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:04.850
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And

121
00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:16.309
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I also filmed a separate video. Okay, let me do not go through the videos I cover, we also have per launch framework. Tell me time when you launch a product from concept to execution.

122
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:40.460
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, this is another question. I have breakdown how to answer them. Now and then we go through 3 by 2 framework, which answer questions regarding why do you want to become a Pm, what set you apart from as a candidate? What do you like? The most and least okay. So it's all using. And how how do you prioritize product features? It's all 3 by 2 framework.

123
00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:55.919
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay? So basically gonna go through all the questions today with all of you guys. But I need one volunteer per person. Why do you want to work in e-commerce company? Okay, this 3 by 2 framework. Okay, so get your answers ready. Now let me pick a volunteer 1st one.

124
00:25:56.531 --> 00:25:59.410
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Is hold on! Let me locate this

125
00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:03.410
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: this one.

126
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:07.520
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Tell me about a time we had a conflict with others, and

127
00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.560
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: anybody has your prepared answers. Raise your hand, please.

128
00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:14.209
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: If not, pick someone random.

129
00:26:15.163 --> 00:26:19.410
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Antika! Perfect! Your hands is up next time. Raise your virtual hand.

130
00:26:19.915 --> 00:26:22.774
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, yeah. Great cool. Give me one second. Let me

131
00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.489
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: let me get my physical timer. Okay? One. Sec. It's behind me.

132
00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:48.180
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: cool.

133
00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:55.690
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And, Kida, let me show you how you guys looks like this where oops I'm not. Oh, my camera.

134
00:26:56.050 --> 00:27:00.179
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I'm here. Okay. My camera wasn't looking at me. Oh, here's how it works everybody.

135
00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:06.999
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, yeah, let me show you this, the new methodology. I always love to

136
00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:14.160
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: improve and grow. It is more fun. Okay, it just it. No background.

137
00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:20.740
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Physical timer guys. Physical timer.

138
00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:43.980
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, looks like this. It will make a sound once it hit. This is from my my son. Okay, if you have a toddler, you will understand what I meant time. Your son or your toddler or your daughter. Okay, once I have a kid, we'll communicate later on. Okay, you need this to deal with your crazy toddler. Okay.

139
00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:50.420
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: yeah. But it works really well for us as well. Okay, so here's how it works.

140
00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:58.419
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Each time any of you guys come into the mock interviews with me or practice anything, me and my coaches we're going to do 2 min, Timer.

141
00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:03.109
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: because your interview 2 min, Max, if one exception

142
00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:17.680
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: tell me a time. We internal product from concept execution. That one was one exception. Okay, that one. You can do 3 min. That's okay. Any other question we need to fit within 2 min. Let them ask you, follow up question. It is okay.

143
00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:25.220
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: but doesn't mean that the 1st time to ask you a question, you give them 10 min answer at least. We have students coming to markings. We give me 6 min answer. I just want to kill myself

144
00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:50.599
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: when doing marketing with her. Okay, just clearly couldn't pass the interview. Just keep on talking, talking. It's like what's going on. Okay. So now, when you time yourself, I'm also going to time myself as well. Okay, so that I can say things true and concise. Okay, I want to improve myself as well. Okay, gonna be like this. Okay, moving forward. It's always like this. Okay, let me do this.

145
00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:54.810
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I don't let me put my background back.

146
00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:59.260
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Why, look at ghost! They're all dark, you know. Scary.

147
00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:09.499
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So do they get the more mutual background. Okay, cool and Kira cool. Let's do this. Do this question.

148
00:29:12.016 --> 00:29:20.690
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Thank you for volunteer. Can you smile? Everyone? You can see it right? Okay, cool. All right. So in the high level. The key points.

149
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:22.949
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: The hybrid manager. One here is right here.

150
00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:27.249
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Tell me time when you have conflict with other people, must ask the interview question.

151
00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:32.850
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: what is the disagreement, right in initial, your flexibility that you're collecting fact

152
00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:47.479
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: on your side. And also, you understand, from other people's point of view, to understand the other people's point of view, and provide what he need based on his point of view. I understand you want that. So therefore give you what you want, and then how you communicate

153
00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.960
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: with with him, because conflict is a fact.

154
00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:56.889
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Emotional conflict is behind the scenes that how you communicate the fact

155
00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:13.850
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you, this need to like, be covered in your answer as well, and eventually reach alignment like straightforward. Okay, cool. Cool 2 min. Okay. Let's do this. A mock interview. And Kira, can you tell me a time that you had conflict with others?

156
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:19.680
Ankita Bhargava: Yes, I thought we were answering the failure question. But okay.

157
00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.470
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, oh, either 1! 0, either! Oh, sorry!

158
00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:23.720
Ankita Bhargava: Okay, this is okay. So I.

159
00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.229
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Do you have dual tunnel.

160
00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:25.620
Ankita Bhargava: Do you.

161
00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:26.400
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Have you?

162
00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:31.030
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I know I want. I want a good answer. Which one do you think can do better.

163
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:35.379
Ankita Bhargava: Either one is okay, whichever one.

164
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.539
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, if either one is okay, tell me this one.

165
00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.239
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Tell me time of conflict with others. 2 min start.

166
00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:54.609
Ankita Bhargava: Okay. So I worked at a company called Lacework, which recently got acquired by Fortinet. But here I was, the senior product manager for Kubernetes security posture management.

167
00:30:54.610 --> 00:31:15.600
Ankita Bhargava: and I was responsible for implementing Cis benchmarks for Amazon Eks and Gke. The conflict between our cloud security posture management and the Kspm team stemmed from competing priorities around implementation of critical features and limited engineering resources.

168
00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:39.550
Ankita Bhargava: So for us, the Kspm team wanted to focus on implementing the Cis benchmarks for Gke, which basically that mandate that was a mandate for 23 customers, which included 10 new customers and 13 pre-existing customers. And for the Cspm team they wanted to implement something called as a

169
00:31:39.550 --> 00:32:03.840
Ankita Bhargava: custom policy feature policy, preview feature, wherein the customers can add new policies or rules based on whatever specific requirements they have both amazing ideas. But at the time, because we did not have enough engineering resources, we had to pick one over the other. The Cspm team

170
00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:16.479
Ankita Bhargava: from a company standpoint it held a higher precedence, due to due to its commitments towards the top tier customers, and also the Company's North Star Matrix. So.

171
00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:36.689
Ankita Bhargava: however, the Kspm team had authority over the Cis for Gke policies, making us responsible for one catching up with the competition, and second, of course, gain new potential employees and expand laceworks, Kubernetes offering. So it was clear that

172
00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:54.389
Ankita Bhargava: because of the priorities, Cspm team got a higher priority and we had to implement the custom policy preview feature. First, st in response to this conflict, we facilitated this collaboration by ensuring that one.

173
00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:57.039
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I give you another 30 seconds. Keep going.

174
00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:25.631
Ankita Bhargava: Okay, we, we basically ensured that the Cspm team could implement this feature first.st And while they were focusing on this, we could also include some of the modules that could be used in future for the Kspm team as well, thus ensuring that we could continue with our roadmap. In the end we did lose 3 of our new potential customers because we had to succumb to

175
00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:43.830
Ankita Bhargava: actually creating the Cspm product. First, st we did, however, end up, creating the Cis benchmark for Gke feature eventually. But yes, there was a loss of 3 customers, but our top tier clients still remained, and that that worked

176
00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:45.630
Ankita Bhargava: all right for us.

177
00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:48.569
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, and Kita actually is

178
00:33:49.190 --> 00:34:04.830
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: a good story. The fundamental of story was good. I also like, when you do interview, you're always smiling. That was great. Actually, it was actually, that was very great instead of very nervous. This is great good for you. Actually, you know, I should smile a lot perfect. Actually, I like it.

179
00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:07.390
Ankita Bhargava: I think.

180
00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:14.940
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: The complexity comes in is the product is very technical. I don't get it.

181
00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:21.529
Ankita Bhargava: Yeah, I in 2 min. I didn't know how I could explain that piece initially.

182
00:34:21.992 --> 00:34:28.009
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: That's why we need to time. You guys, okay, you guys understand this.

183
00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:33.460
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Let's say, I give you 4 min. I still don't get it.

184
00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:34.769
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: That's my point.

185
00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:44.330
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, I think it's about how you tell the story you gave us. You gave us too much technical details. Make us just don't get it.

186
00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:56.140
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So even if it's not that, that's the principle of the teaching methodology. Here we give you the Grail framework the different different way to tell the story because you want to tell story. What hiring manager want to hear?

187
00:34:56.719 --> 00:35:14.069
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Not all the technical details. And if I give you 4 min, or even 6 min. Nancy will tell you everything I guarantee you. You will understand. Aws, Cloud, if you give me 6 min, I guarantee you. If you do that interview. You get killed for sure, and then they still don't get it

188
00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:30.429
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: to be right. Okay. Only if they're in cloud they probably might get it right? I I build cloud, probably before I still don't get it. Okay. So so it's not about the time. But let me show you how to say, shorter and more concise, that give the hybrid manager was one here, and

189
00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:39.830
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: if they do want to dive into technical detail, let them ask you those for questions. No problem. Okay. So now let me help you rewrite your story. Now let me time yourself

190
00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.069
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: for 3 min, rewrite it.

191
00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.960
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay? So the story could like this

192
00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:57.099
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: when I am. Describe your title, for example, when I am a product owner of ABC things? Or is it current title pro manager? Or you're more technical

193
00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.340
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: program manager.

194
00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:10.399
Ankita Bhargava: So I took a gap year to be a stay at home. Mom, this is my 1st session here, and yes, my title is a senior product manager for my company, lacework.

195
00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:11.140
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay.

196
00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:14.810
Ankita Bhargava: Yeah, it's been a. It's been 8 months since I left it. So yes.

197
00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:23.789
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It's okay. When I am a senior product manager at Abcd Company, I had a conflict with

198
00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.140
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: the engineering team was a title

199
00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:30.990
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: about just a very clean statement

200
00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:42.870
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I had a conflict with, and was head of engineering about the resources and priorities to work on the cloud offerings.

201
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:44.260
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Very simple.

202
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:46.780
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay. Next part.

203
00:36:47.920 --> 00:37:06.469
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: then our part of framework. That's where you can expand more. Why is this important thing? You keep the summary upfront? G means get the point right? Our part of framework. What do you mean about conflict with cloud resources? Right? You literally spend lots of time upfront, really telling us what's going on with the cloud. We still don't get it.

204
00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:30.349
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: that's my point. So we we dumb it down, for other people simplify. You can say the following, I made up something random. Okay? You can say, you know what? When we create or background information, we are creating, our company offers of the the most comprehensive, like cloud infrastructure for fortune companies.

205
00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:50.760
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and each company has the priorities, and all the priorities are very different. There was one client. Clearly they are like the biggest hospital network. They want to prioritize Abcd Cloud features. But the head of engineering said no to those prioritized features.

206
00:37:50.850 --> 00:38:09.469
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: so therefore, I must sit down with them to figure out, how can we really reprioritize? And it is true we need to give up on the biggest client in the market right now. Here's what I did. 1, 2, 3. Now, 1, 2, 3. You talk about like acf, whatever cloud name we don't even get it. You can make it simple number one.

207
00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:26.889
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: We identify number One. I try to investigate why he doesn't want to work on this most important healthcare cloud. Oh, what I what I discovered was that, oh! His original

208
00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:37.990
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: product, feature is called ABC. What an M. Fin. To enable that we need to work on 5 different features even enable this and this and this, this

209
00:38:39.460 --> 00:39:02.780
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and the second step, I try to collect information from my perspective to collect more data to really understand. Okay, so to really work on Fas product. It really takes so long. What if we can do this and this and this, this potentially can solve the problem? Number 3, I presented my discovery with him, and through one-on-one meetings or 5 rounds of

210
00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:11.299
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: product review, or 10 rounds of the Abcd. Things, and he was able to really get it, and towards the end.

211
00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:27.000
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and we finally get aligned. And even if we lost 3 clients. But this kind of after this new structure, we always can meet the best, whatever requirement from customer. I'm just giving you a framework. Okay? I want you to do this, Ankita.

212
00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:32.005
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Can you simplify for me using the frame I gave you.

213
00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:37.950
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: let me reset timer, so I want you to reset timer for 3 min.

214
00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:47.270
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Can you start telling me who did you have a conflict with? About what right now.

215
00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:48.984
Ankita Bhargava: Okay,

216
00:39:49.750 --> 00:40:14.280
Ankita Bhargava: Oh, so the conflict was with another Pm team. Basically. So another product manager who was responsible for cloud security product management. I was responsible for the Kubernetes Security product management team. So because we shared the engineering resources, it became quite difficult to implement 2 features at the same time. So

217
00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:41.329
Ankita Bhargava: so the end goal was the end. The eventual decision was to 1st focus on who the top clients are. So for us. Macy's and city were the top 2 customers, and they were the focus for our company. And that's why we we focused on building the product for the Cspm team first, st and then we came on to the the product that we had to build for Kspm team.

218
00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:44.219
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: What is cspm, what is K.

219
00:40:44.220 --> 00:41:08.650
Ankita Bhargava: Yeah, so so this is basically a cloud security company. And Cspm is cloud security posture management. Essentially, they're a set of rules and policies that every company needs to implement, so that if whenever they get audited they would not be charged money for misplacing any rules, and also not get a tagged

220
00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:31.019
Ankita Bhargava: because it's a security company. So not get attacked on because you you did not follow some rules. So simple example is aws password right? So if someone, if some attack happens and somebody else tries to put in the password it anyone can. Anyone can pose as you.

221
00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:42.520
Ankita Bhargava: So that's the whole gist of it so. But this little feature had nothing to do with security per se. So that's why I don't know if I should bring it up.

222
00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:58.349
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: No. Does this feature? Is this feature relevant to solving the conflict? For example, if if I, if I heard you correctly, is you and the other part manager had a conflict. Because you're working on Kubernetes, and he's working on what is it.

223
00:41:59.213 --> 00:42:00.200
Ankita Bhargava: Cloud, security.

224
00:42:00.673 --> 00:42:01.620
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Class security.

225
00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:04.770
Ankita Bhargava: Google, cloud, posture, management, essentially.

226
00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:22.309
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Cloud security sounds better than Google. Cloud cloud security sounds better because it's too complicated. People are Google Cloud versus other different cloud to say he's managing cloud security and managing Kubernetes, and my company is a Cloud Security Company. Am I right?

227
00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:23.150
Ankita Bhargava: Yes.

228
00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:31.299
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, my company is a Cloud Security Company and he's managing Google Cloud Security product. I'm managing Kubernetes

229
00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:37.850
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: now to. However, both of us share the same type of engineering effort.

230
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:48.879
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Here is how? And that's where the conflict coming in. I want to work on my feature. He want to work his feature, and that that's very like this conflict. We go. We go head to head every single day.

231
00:42:49.420 --> 00:43:00.269
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Here is how I solved. And then you said another. One piece of information. We are part of framework. For example, say, what if you and him does not solve the problem together?

232
00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:19.029
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: For example, you can say this is very sincere issue, because both Kubernetes and security, one of the most important thing for our company, if we always go like like, had conflict all the time. None of these features get implemented.

233
00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:21.170
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, that

234
00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:29.749
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: would just literally kill the company. So therefore I must solve the problem. And then I went to him and and understand

235
00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:35.510
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: what's going on. Why, he always felt like his security. Feature is more important than Kubernetics.

236
00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:42.979
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Well, what I discovered is that he himself is on the high pressure to deliver a security product.

237
00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:59.619
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And it's not like he disagree. Kubernetes is not important. Of course, all those cloud features like it's of Kubernetes, the basics of cloud. It is important, but he's on a high pressure. Deliver his things

238
00:44:00.248 --> 00:44:05.410
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and then, after I understand from his perspective. So I decide to do this.

239
00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:12.740
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: What if we're able to create the framework to prioritize our customers and then

240
00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:32.660
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: figure out what type of feature need to get work on first, st so that we always like have a customer 1st methodology, so that he is able to have a better rationale to like, push, or prioritize present to his boss, instead of getting blamed for not able to deliver the product.

241
00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:37.470
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And then we sit down a second step. So we decide to sit down

242
00:44:37.590 --> 00:45:05.280
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: to really use the new Methodology to evaluate which customer goes 1st and well, what we discovered that Macy's and Abcd Walmart and the ABC. Top. 2 customers are the most important customer we had, because they pay us 5 million dollars every single year with that in mind. And then we further break down our priorities different things. But the the next part I do not. I, personally don't understand is

243
00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:08.989
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: why use that Csps feature versus the little

244
00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:18.920
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you prioritize which customer. But why? Csps, you know you have a lot of jargon Csps versus those 2 things important

245
00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:22.089
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: in this context, or is the thing

246
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:24.239
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: that you may or may not need it.

247
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:30.830
Ankita Bhargava: Could you reframe the question again.

248
00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:38.059
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Hmm! So we went all the way towards you are trying to describe

249
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:45.200
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you prioritize, which customer is more more important, which Macy's plus another company was straightforward.

250
00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:49.360
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Let's say you already know Macy's more important. So what?

251
00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:56.919
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So you implement csps, whatever stuff. So tell me so what? Let's say, Macy's most important. So so.

252
00:45:57.870 --> 00:46:12.609
Ankita Bhargava: Yeah. So so which was the case for us as well. So because Macy's, or whichever customer top customer was most important, we ended up building their product feature first, st and then we we went on to

253
00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:17.909
Ankita Bhargava: add some of the key frameworks or structure

254
00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:26.010
Ankita Bhargava: for our prod, for our product feature as well. So this custom policy preview feature was a common

255
00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:33.590
Ankita Bhargava: feature for both the teams, and instead of focusing on building the

256
00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:47.870
Ankita Bhargava: the, the thing that we had on our roadmap. We ended up prioritizing this because Cspm. Team had a priority. They created this feature. So we ended up adding our adding this

257
00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:51.920
Ankita Bhargava: this feature to our roadmap as well, and and implemented it

258
00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:56.430
Ankita Bhargava: sooner, but I mean at the end we still lost 3 clients, so

259
00:46:56.850 --> 00:47:04.439
Ankita Bhargava: it wasn't the best decision from a Kubernetes standpoint, but from a company standpoint. Yes.

260
00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:14.279
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I see. So you can just okay, based on what you said. So and then step number 2 after we sit down and reevaluate the most important thing will be, discover that

261
00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:43.960
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: in order to help Macy's, Macy's our biggest client, whatever. So was what Macy's had. We need to implement this Abcd features which is able to enable Macy's as the biggest client to to get the result faster. And this Abcd features would actually should be the number one priority for the entire company to secure the biggest client.

262
00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:50.400
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and instead, we focus on smaller features, such as securities or Kubernetes.

263
00:47:50.700 --> 00:48:16.989
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: With that in mind we went to the surface that we are able to reprioritize our entire roadmap. Put on this Abcd. Whatever the new features, number one, and then work on Kubernetes, and plus whatever security features. After we reprioritize this, the entire company got Abcd Impact. You can talk about the entire company was able to streamline the process being able to serve

264
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:29.339
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: all 500 fortune, 500 companies with 20% faster result. I want something like that. Can you tell me what is the impact after you implement this new feature.

265
00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:32.943
Ankita Bhargava: Just

266
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:42.410
Ankita Bhargava: re contract right it. It was added to the contract, so we would have lost the client if we wouldn't have implemented this feature first.st

267
00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:44.119
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But you say you lost 3 clients.

268
00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:50.839
Ankita Bhargava: Yeah, but the the biggest client, Macy's. We would have lost them if if this feature weren't implemented first.st

269
00:48:53.430 --> 00:49:02.959
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, so you save clients. In that case I wouldn't mention you. You still lost 3 clients. In that case I would just say

270
00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:05.079
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: as the end.

271
00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:07.609
Ankita Bhargava: We saved Macy's.

272
00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:09.410
Ankita Bhargava: We save the biggest. Yeah.

273
00:49:09.814 --> 00:49:25.990
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Think after implement this, we are able to save the biggest client, which is Macy's. We totally saved the face where, I say, save the future revenue of our company by addressing our our differences, but focus on

274
00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:32.590
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: the priority submission of the entire company, instead of putting ourselves first.st

275
00:49:33.330 --> 00:49:38.039
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: What I learned from this from from this experience. Is that

276
00:49:39.490 --> 00:49:42.890
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: what you're learning before I made out something for you? What? What you're learning.

277
00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:55.420
Ankita Bhargava: Voice of customer and company comes first.st business targets have to be met first, st and your own product, feature or product priority can

278
00:49:55.640 --> 00:50:01.329
Ankita Bhargava: is sometimes it, it needs to stop so that bigger priorities can take place.

279
00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:03.800
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Perfect, hasn't say, very well.

280
00:50:04.310 --> 00:50:16.310
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: okay. You can make it slightly more more condensed. But but the concept is perfect. I think hiring manager want to hear what you just said. Okay, so that's how you rewrite it. The only thing I kind of.

281
00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:22.049
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: That's a better better framework. The story how you write a story. The only thing

282
00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:28.119
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I'm thinking about changing the story completely to answer the conflict, as

283
00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:42.029
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: sounds like Oo. Will make the conflict part more straightforward. Sounds like you 2 have a conflict eventually, the way you solve the conflict is, do not work on any of your product feature. It work on the 3rd party's product feature, right?

284
00:50:43.053 --> 00:50:59.389
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Which sounds interesting because usually talk track is there's a you and him have conflict eventually work on yours or his, or something between. Now there's nothing between you. Say, you know what. Let's not work on any of those just work on 3rd one. It it kind of

285
00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:24.670
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: kind of works, also kind of weird. So if you have another story that's like it between you and me, you and him, and you pick something in between, or choose yours or his something like that, instead of the 3rd party feature. I think that's a more straightforward answer. However, your question also fit how to make your question fit more in terms of conflict. Here is.

286
00:51:26.370 --> 00:51:35.420
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you can just aid, say it in the middle, saying that what we discovered that our conflict

287
00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:41.470
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: was as mainly based on personal needs, but but forgot about the mission of the company.

288
00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:46.590
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Then we reevaluate the priorities. The company we discover the following.

289
00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:58.029
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: yeah, just so you can add that in to show the interviewer that the the conference so small. So we decided, let's just focus on something more important than our personal conflict, so that we're fine.

290
00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:05.830
Ankita Bhargava: And one last question, how old should the conflict be? So if I have another

291
00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:16.889
Ankita Bhargava: conflict story from maybe 2 companies ago. But it's a great story does, I can still use it? Or would you say that only the ones

292
00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:18.200
Ankita Bhargava: should work.

293
00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:24.180
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yes, you can, because if you let's re-preparing for all the final interview, you're going to guess

294
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:47.660
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: exhausted about all your questions, you will be asked so many different, so many questions. So yes, you can use that 2 years ago for this one, and then something else for a different story. The story we just crafted can be used for a different question, which is, for example, when we had to sacrifice yourself for the goods of the company. That that's perfect answer.

295
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:50.100
Ankita Bhargava: Thank you. Susie.

296
00:52:50.100 --> 00:53:18.619
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Cool. Okay, cool. All right. I hope this inspiration showing you guys how you read your story. The key points is here. The key points here. It's all here. Okay, nothing go beyond here. It's more about, hey, implement this. I literally have students in the past. Nancy, everyone use the same framework. Why gonna work? Everyone use my framework? How many implement correctly? Yeah. So that's where we help you implement. So it's the same framework. Real framework is the same framework. Right? It's more about implementation. Okay, cool. Now, let's go to the next 1. 0, before do this forgot mention.

297
00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:23.000
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Here, let me let me stop sharing

298
00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:25.959
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: this one. This one oops oops.

299
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:32.529
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, okay, I sign out the zoom. Oh, I don't know. Google slides. Sign me out. Sorry. Let me sign on.

300
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:33.620
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: That's nice.

301
00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:43.460
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It kicked me out every 2 weeks and couldn't go one sec

302
00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:47.560
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: again.

303
00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:56.060
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, it's nice. Back back up.

304
00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:04.469
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, let me share my screen again.

305
00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:07.860
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Hi.

306
00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:20.120
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Google Chrome, cool, cool, cool. Yeah. Everybody turn off your AI check out. If this is your name

307
00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:28.840
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: here, you should tell you. AI, okay. Now here is well. Oh, something reminder quickly I forgot to talk the announcement. Hey?

308
00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:55.130
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Tomorrow I'm doing a feedback session for all I want to redesign my webinar, whatever. Webinar, you guys, the masterclass, you guys took to join us when redesign my webinar, I welcome both senior and aspiring. Pm, join me. I want to redesign it completely. So if you have time tomorrow, join me. If not, send me your voice messages on this course, help me to redesign it. Okay, cool. So now let's continue right here.

309
00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:01.750
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Just locked down and let me go back.

310
00:55:05.712 --> 00:55:10.539
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay. So now, next question is, can we tell when you failed?

311
00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:17.780
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Anyone have answer. Okay, Jack, okay. Tell me. Tell me you felt 2 min. Let's go.

312
00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:21.739
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Yep, yep, thank you. Let me pull it up.

313
00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:23.439
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oops! This one.

314
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:25.060
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Oh, can you hear me? By the way.

315
00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:26.509
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yes, I can go ahead.

316
00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:27.799
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Okay, thank you.

317
00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:56.079
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Okay, so I worked as a senior sales compensation program manager for twilio. And I was responsible for the monthly compensation data refresh at each month end. However, the data always has issues at the last moment, which does not allow me enough time to audit the data and present the data to our sales leaders. And this is a big issue, because.

318
00:55:56.484 --> 00:56:16.289
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: our sales leader need this data refresh each month to accurately update to be up to be accurately app updated. Because without this accurate data, sales leaders did not have the context to make sales strategy decisions and our company would lose revenue as a result.

319
00:56:17.075 --> 00:56:17.779
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: So

320
00:56:20.111 --> 00:56:38.309
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: and the actions that took was step one. I communicated with our engineering team and discussed viable options to give more time for data. Audit so after discussion we've we, we found that we can generate a preliminary data set at the beginning of each month.

321
00:56:38.845 --> 00:56:50.119
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: So what I did was I devised a process to use the preliminary data at each month, beginning use that preliminary data to audit the data in advance.

322
00:56:50.582 --> 00:57:17.780
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Which gives us about 20 more days to audit the data. And we can resolve 80% of the issues in the preliminary data, so that when it comes to the monthly month end data refresh, we have much more time actually, like, you know, have like, 2020 more days to do the data audits which helped us increase the data data accuracy from 80% to 98%.

323
00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:38.309
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: So the lesson I learned from this experience is that always leave additional time for data audits. And always, you know, devise programs. If there's a time limit to do additional audits and always prepare for unexpected situations like this. So yeah.

324
00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:42.980
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I'm not sure it's me tonight.

325
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:44.930
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: My brain doesn't work or not.

326
00:57:45.810 --> 00:57:47.580
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I still find it very technical

327
00:57:48.140 --> 00:58:07.420
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: is I don't get technical thing tonight or what's going on. Other people feel technical. Okay? Maybe my brain doesn't work. I think yours. I feel the same as Anika is very technical. I feel like yours, technical as well. Maybe my brain is right tonight. I feel like, why is this so technical stuff?

328
00:58:08.290 --> 00:58:16.700
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: About things failed creating audit your data. Okay, so so let's let's slow down.

329
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:24.329
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Let's add non-technical element to it. So people can follow it closely. Let me time myself. Let me do that

330
00:58:24.550 --> 00:58:25.630
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: it's 5 min.

331
00:58:26.050 --> 00:58:26.690
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay,

332
00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:36.560
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: 6 min in total, let's rewrite it together instead of me telling what to do. Okay, rewrite together. Okay, so number one can use one sentence describing

333
00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:40.179
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: what you what did you fail? You failed to do what.

334
00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:54.400
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Yeah. So I failed because the data always has issues at the last minute. So because of that, I was not able to report the data in time to our leadership. And because, yeah.

335
00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:56.090
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Here comes Robin.

336
00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:57.789
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Everybody pay attention.

337
00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:05.169
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Both Anika and Jack forgot to tell us the background information when I was

338
00:59:06.234 --> 00:59:15.450
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: per owner, or you've transitioned to pm, so you you can have a title product owner, or of data data dashboard for Abcd Company.

339
00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:18.440
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I felt.

340
00:59:19.935 --> 00:59:23.840
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So I felt

341
00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:34.369
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: to prepare the data product. Oh, my, my data, the data product I created always fell

342
00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:43.199
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: to whatever at last minute fail. 4. To present the best accuracy result at last. Minute. Okay, very clean upfront.

343
00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:46.259
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Can you tell us the

344
00:59:47.220 --> 01:00:03.249
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: what? What's what's what it for is a healthcare company. So you fail your patient data last minute. That sounds horrible, or you're a social media company. You fail, influencer report. So so what? It so so tell me more.

345
01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:05.080
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Yeah, what? The business impact?

346
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:25.269
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Yes, yes. So the our company is a communication communication data company. So you know, text data email data we sell those services to other companies. So like, let's say, you purchase a T-shirt from Uniqlo Uniqlo sends you a text confirmation.

347
01:00:25.656 --> 01:00:50.020
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: That is implemented by us. So our our sales. They sell this service to other companies and our team. We prepare the the data for sales compensation. So how much commission we give to our sales? Rep, and yeah, we we prepare for that data essentially. And if we don't have this data, our sales leaders don't know how to

348
01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:59.260
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: effectively sell the product to their customers, to maximize the commission to the sales, rep, and also maximize the revenue for our company.

349
01:00:59.770 --> 01:01:01.210
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Missing 1 point.

350
01:01:02.110 --> 01:01:21.199
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It's a Saas product. So anytime you purchase something, they give you a tax communication confirmation, and then you sell the tax communication confirmation packages. So it's a Saas product each time they sell something. Your sales team is going to get commission. But you're you're calculating the sales compensation data

351
01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:25.710
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: so that they have their, they're they're motivated to work on it.

352
01:01:26.090 --> 01:01:27.619
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Yes. Exactly. Yeah.

353
01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:28.869
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Cool, all right.

354
01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:31.210
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I'm oh.

355
01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:43.930
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Oh, I have a quick question. So do I need to explain that? I I guess you know, for an interview. Before I answer the question, I always tell the business context of the company that did I work for.

356
01:01:43.930 --> 01:01:44.410
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Without.

357
01:01:44.410 --> 01:01:45.809
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Be helpful. Okay, okay.

358
01:01:45.810 --> 01:02:06.889
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Significantly. Both you and Anika and almost everybody. You need to tell them short business concept behind it. For example, whenever I tell my smart. I create smart cities product using AI to help cities reduce car crashes. Right? So very clear, clean description of my product.

359
01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:17.739
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yours should be very clean. So my my company sells a Saas product that gives text confirmation

360
01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:24.560
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: to consumer who purchase any product online or in person.

361
01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:52.129
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: For example, anytime you purchase a piece of clothes they give you from any kind of store. They give you a text coming compensation, confirmation, hey? Thank you for your purchase of one suit from Abcd Store that's managed by us, and then say what you said. Oh, and then the salesperson, we're doing this, and but our sales compensation number is always wrong the last minute. That sounds really bad. So therefore I must. I must fix it.

362
01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:59.139
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: That that's really bad thing that could happen to us. We must fix it if you can use some number to prove it even better.

363
01:02:59.390 --> 01:03:02.960
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: which could be 80% of time.

364
01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:04.720
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It was wrong.

365
01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:10.759
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And then we send out like hundreds of text messages, we have

366
01:03:10.930 --> 01:03:22.891
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: thousands of whatever, like big clients, 80% of time. The sales compensation, calculation was wrong. Oh, that sounds really bad. Right? As example, right?

367
01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:31.320
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: yeah, the context is missing. We just heard all the data. I was like, what what tag is so technical. Oh, okay, here's how I fix the data.

368
01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:33.830
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: 1, 2, 3, which is fine.

369
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:36.800
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay. But you want to see right now.

370
01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:40.950
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You didn't talk about

371
01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:47.340
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: the the human element, part of it. For example. I think you're talking about technical element.

372
01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:51.570
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You realize this and that. Can you add one human element to it?

373
01:03:54.078 --> 01:03:57.300
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Can you specify what you mean by human element?

374
01:03:58.570 --> 01:04:00.176
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: For example,

375
01:04:01.450 --> 01:04:12.490
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: After I talked to the salesperson, I realized that the reason of us providing the wrong data was because sales reps didn't.

376
01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:17.609
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: didn't enter the customer information correctly that led to one failure.

377
01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:28.309
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And then I work on technical issues. How can we hold sales rep accountable to enter customer information. Oh, then, I create this feature, that feature to make it work

378
01:04:28.570 --> 01:04:31.649
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: as an example. Right? So yours is all like.

379
01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:51.590
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Let me show you how to run SQL. Or my SQL. Database. I did that and this and that and that. So technical. Okay, great. All right. So that's what I meant. Let me do this? Can you? 3 sentences, each sentence of 5 keywords? Tell me what you did of your 3 actions to fix the problem

380
01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:52.679
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: number one.

381
01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:58.025
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Yeah, so number, step,

382
01:04:58.740 --> 01:04:59.500
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: 5 q. 1.

383
01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:00.069
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Send it.

384
01:05:03.786 --> 01:05:05.274
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: let me see,

385
01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:19.129
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: number one is to discuss with engineering team. Yeah. 1st 2 points and then find viable. OP

386
01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.260
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: explore viable options.

387
01:05:24.146 --> 01:05:28.579
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: I I would say that that would be my step one, but that there, that's only 3 points.

388
01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:30.700
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, second, second, step.

389
01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:50.720
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Yeah. Second step. Yes. So second step is preliminary data. So like, that's, that's the data that's not ready yet. But we can still use it. And I would say, the second point is beginning of the month, like we can get that data much earlier. Since it's

390
01:05:50.890 --> 01:05:52.817
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: it's preliminary data.

391
01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:58.840
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: and then we can use that to to do the audit. So that's the 3rd points.

392
01:05:59.433 --> 01:06:05.359
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: So like preliminary data, beginning of the month. And then data audit.

393
01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:11.369
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: would that be still too technical or.

394
01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:13.740
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Think about it.

395
01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:26.639
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I still don't understand why I always messed up at the end of the month.

396
01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:27.810
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Okay.

397
01:06:27.810 --> 01:06:28.429
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Can you tell me.

398
01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:37.934
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: I see. Yeah. So the reason why it was the data was broken at the at the end of the month was

399
01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:44.130
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: there are delays in the process of.

400
01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:51.850
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: So this I I can just like, you know, tell you, in this whole paragraph, and we can refine it. But

401
01:06:52.330 --> 01:06:57.561
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: there are a lot of steps like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and then, like

402
01:06:58.570 --> 01:07:01.050
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: let's say, step 2, get delayed.

403
01:07:01.210 --> 01:07:16.230
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: In that case it it goes down to step 5, but like we only catch it in step 5, and we have to go audit all the way back to step one, do the audit. And then, like, yeah, and it happens like every month just like.

404
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.570
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Perfect.

405
01:07:16.570 --> 01:07:17.040
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Yeah.

406
01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:25.020
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: This is. This is a perfect example. You gave us all technical stuff. We don't do all the audit we freaking don't understand. What do we mean by audit data.

407
01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:27.160
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Okay, here's what it's saying.

408
01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:30.589
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And your step will be changed as well. Step number one.

409
01:07:31.710 --> 01:07:39.769
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: We try to investigate. Why on earth, by the end of the month the sales worth of commission data is always wrong.

410
01:07:40.810 --> 01:07:45.789
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: or 80% of time is always wrong, whatever whatever whatever numbers. Okay.

411
01:07:46.010 --> 01:07:54.150
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And and then you use one sentence describe like, what you discussed will be discovered that there are 10 steps.

412
01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:56.670
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, okay.

413
01:07:57.390 --> 01:08:05.710
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: step number one. I told you 5 words. And then the second sentence describing what you discovered, we discovered that there are 10 steps

414
01:08:06.090 --> 01:08:10.970
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: to go to calculate sales commission for all the own e-commerce stores.

415
01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:15.649
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: each of steps. They have one a few days delay.

416
01:08:16.029 --> 01:08:29.249
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and then add on top, on top each other. Step one delay one day, step 5, delay by 2 days. Step 7, device whatever another 5 days by the end of the day it's always like delayed, and then it's always calculated incorrectly

417
01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:34.109
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: with that in mind I immediately went to stand number 2.

418
01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:46.000
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I look into the engineering solution team to investigate what are the possible, what, what are the possible solutions is is available. Then I discovered that

419
01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:47.990
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: step 3.

420
01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:54.299
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I implemented the solution which is to which is collect early

421
01:08:54.420 --> 01:09:09.990
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: data, preliminary data early this month and do audit like at the beginning of the month to prevent any steps that's delayed or broken. So we catch instead number one before it triggered down to step number 10.

422
01:09:10.790 --> 01:09:16.309
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: That's all you need to say, wow, yours is so complex.

423
01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:24.760
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, yeah, that means data audit. Oh, oh, that's data audit. Then you say, that's called data audit.

424
01:09:25.090 --> 01:09:25.810
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Okay.

425
01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:28.099
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: That always say the 10 steps.

426
01:09:28.769 --> 01:09:38.529
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It doesn't matter how many steps make it. Make it lots of steps, 10 steps. We catch it in step number one, that preliminary data. What does this mean to us? We have no clue either.

427
01:09:38.779 --> 01:09:39.259
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Oh!

428
01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:39.670
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: And.

429
01:09:39.670 --> 01:09:50.520
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: We, we just use preliminator earlier so that we can catch instead number one and audit instead, number one and 2 as early as possible before hit number 10. 0, that makes so much sense.

430
01:09:51.170 --> 01:09:55.260
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: that's it. We don't need technical description of so many data stuff.

431
01:09:57.990 --> 01:09:59.010
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: We don't get it.

432
01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:00.510
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, wow!

433
01:10:00.510 --> 01:10:01.480
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Too technical.

434
01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:03.240
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Makes sense, makes sense.

435
01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:04.700
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, cool. Okay, so now.

436
01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:05.460
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Thank you.

437
01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:08.099
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: No problem. I hope this inspiration for everybody

438
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:11.409
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: in terms of how to make things less technical.

439
01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:17.139
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Again, if you say the keywords I described. Be easier to understand. You can fit in 2 min easily.

440
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:22.380
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Then people get it because nobody want to look into excel sheet like

441
01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:25.659
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: it hurt people's brain in general.

442
01:10:26.450 --> 01:10:28.790
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, so it's like, what would you describe is fine.

443
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:35.649
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And the loss of term data audit, which freaking don't know. What does data audit mean we saw you rerun your numbers. That's what I thought.

444
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:42.260
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I don't know. Okay, cool, all right. A whole inspiration for everybody. So now let's move to Senior Pm. Questions.

445
01:10:42.770 --> 01:10:46.979
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: If you're a senior Pm. Help me answer this question.

446
01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:53.309
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: tell me a time when you reposition your product, hands up. If you have your answers ready.

447
01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:04.840
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Nikhel? You have a question, Nicholl. You can re.

448
01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:07.710
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah.

449
01:11:09.450 --> 01:11:11.780
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Why? Why, Nicole, do you have a question?

Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: hold on! Hold on! Hold on! I saw the questions. Why doesn't?

452
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.630
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, I have lots of people. Question, okay, hey, guys.

453
01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:39.490
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I couldn't catch your questions here. So many questions you can. You can see the historical questions people submitted. Distract me.

454
01:11:39.952 --> 01:11:41.040
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Put it here.

455
01:11:41.290 --> 01:11:43.609
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: If you have any other questions.

456
01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:49.999
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah. Sunday office hours. Okay, cool

457
01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:53.060

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:09.859
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: office hours. Sunday. Find today's date. And there's a link you can enter your info questions here. Okay, you can discuss in the Zoom chat. But if your questions for me put it here.

460
01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:14.450
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: okay, but the zoom chat chat is very complicated

461
01:12:14.877 --> 01:12:22.312
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: for me to follow, which is a very distracting, but question for me, put it here. If you want to discuss or discuss, I don't check the chat. Okay, cool.

462
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:32.100
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: continue. Okay, let me pick a senior Pm. Can sell. If a senior Pm. Or anyone prepared this answer, tell me time when you repositioning a product.

463
01:12:36.010 --> 01:12:38.309
Vishal Bhoir: Documentansa. I can go for this.

464
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:40.590
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Hmm, okay.

465
01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:47.840
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, camera on camera on we shall. Cameron.

466
01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:55.439
Vishal Bhoir: You see.

467
01:12:56.090 --> 01:12:59.470
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yes. Okay, let's do this.

468
01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:01.040
Vishal Bhoir: Singaporean Question.

469
01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:02.830
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, heck.

470
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:06.450
Vishal Bhoir: You guys got.

471
01:13:06.450 --> 01:13:07.580
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Hmm, hmm.

472
01:13:08.303 --> 01:13:09.010
Vishal Bhoir: Okay, so.

473
01:13:09.010 --> 01:13:11.440
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: No, no, no, no, no, no, not yet. Sorry. I'm just checking.

474
01:13:12.770 --> 01:13:13.520
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Hmm.

475
01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:22.020
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: okay. Let me set the tone a little bit. Everybody for coaching purposes. Why, I said, the senior Pm. Question is.

476
01:13:22.570 --> 01:13:31.710
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: tell me a time when you reposition, a product is more advanced. Question for Senior Pm. This happened for lots of senior Pm. Questions. They may not ask you

477
01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:36.570
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: exact same titles, the same keywords in the repositional product.

478
01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:51.840
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Let me ask you through different angle. You're gonna oh, when when discovery doesn't worry, how to pivot, change it, how do you do it? Something something like that. And you had to change shift anything you go here, you change okay? And

479
01:13:52.690 --> 01:14:03.689
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: in my prep training I give you my sample example. But I want you to define what I mean by repositioning a product. Repositioning your product means originally the product. Want to go to east.

480
01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:06.009
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and you make to go to south

481
01:14:06.250 --> 01:14:11.559
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: or north or west any other direction. But it it's a we change it.

482
01:14:11.910 --> 01:14:18.080
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: We go for something different. At least they should be sound like different. The best

483
01:14:18.570 --> 01:14:24.630
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: answer I've ever heard is from your alumni, David Lin, so interesting.

484
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.750
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: His original product was a dating app.

485
01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:42.780
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, sorry, sir, I was wrong. His original product was educational, app helping people to study better in university. Then he reposition a product into a dating app.

486
01:14:43.580 --> 01:15:00.160
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: That sounds big repositioning, but it's the same customer segmentation, or 21 year old 20 year old teenagers studying in university, and then also the back end of the gamification and the code database actually is similar.

487
01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:06.739
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: He just changed the value proposition of the product. He packaged the front end completely. But back end thing

488
01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:10.009
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: that's called repositioning a product that's the best.

489
01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:13.120
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: most obvious repositioning I've ever heard.

490
01:15:13.350 --> 01:15:27.890
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But I want you guys to think about what something had done in the past. Even if you did small changes, I want you to make it like bigger shift. You need to. Re, you can reposition your customer segmentation.

491
01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:35.909
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you can reposition your go-to-market strategy for them. The example I gave you is go-to-market strategy.

492
01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:44.199
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You can reposition like value, proposition or product. You can reposition many things, many different things. But you need to have a name to it

493
01:15:44.450 --> 01:15:47.260
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: to make it very obvious. What is a what is? B?

494
01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:50.499
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay? So we and also tell us

495
01:15:50.690 --> 01:15:59.560
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: what is A and B at the beginning, so that we understand? Very obviously, what did you reposition? Okay, we shall 2 min. Let's start.

496
01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:03.160
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Tell me time when you reposition a product star.

497
01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:20.429
Vishal Bhoir: Okay? So when I was working for Aig as a senior product manager we were developing a platform called Grc analytics, which is a integrated analytics and reporting platform for different stakeholders.

498
01:16:20.817 --> 01:16:36.719
Vishal Bhoir: Initially, when we were running the working group. You know, meeting with different corporate functions. It seems like they were doing reporting in silos. And that's what is hindering the top management to get the aggregated analytics and reporting.

499
01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:47.370
Vishal Bhoir: So our team decided to build a integrated platform for all of them. We had multiple voice of customers with individual corporate team

500
01:16:47.870 --> 01:17:05.729
Vishal Bhoir: understood their require requirements pain points, and then we had the road map to deliver a integrated platform we delivered the 1st Mvp. And we provided access to all the corporate users to start using and providing feedback

501
01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:30.639
Vishal Bhoir: Later on, we found out like, when we saw the different user usage of this platform. It seems like the number of user who has subscriber size subscribe didn't access this platform. Then we got to know, like we interacted individuals. We got to know, like what we did is we integrated all the different features into one platform

502
01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:39.919
Vishal Bhoir: and guess what is not expected by individual corporate team, right? Because they wanted some reporting based on their customization.

503
01:17:40.090 --> 01:17:59.880
Vishal Bhoir: So we need to reposition our platform so that it becomes more customized for individual corporate function. So we change our roadmap. We decided to customize each platform for individual team requirement, and then we re release Mvp. For individual teams.

504
01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:22.559
Vishal Bhoir: We got the data of how much it is being utilized, and we seems a substantial increase in the usage of the platform. So that's what we learned like, even though we think like one stop shop can, you know, help individual to access everything in one platform. But in real life that's not the case.

505
01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:30.410
Vishal Bhoir: Every team has their different requirements, and they want a platform which suits their requirements. So that's what we learn later on.

506
01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:46.829
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, the story is great, it gets better better towards the end. But but it's a good example. Beginning is kind of long to get your get to your point. But after you get to your point, it's good. Okay, we need change of sequence a little bit, but but it's good.

507
01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:58.149
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, and also what you reposition is good as well, and and also very clear regarding what is a what is B? Okay. So everybody where where is good for his is.

508
01:18:59.430 --> 01:19:09.269
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It's very clear, and also sounds like, Wow, that's a very strategic move. His original, his A was. He has a platform that does everything in the one place for his customer.

509
01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:15.709
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: B is, let's just break it down into individual features. You can sell to a customer

510
01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:25.350
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: so so that you can increase adoption right now where room for improvement is.

511
01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:30.790
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It takes really long time to get to your point. You you save it towards the last.

512
01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:36.220
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: flip it earlier. And

513
01:19:38.510 --> 01:19:47.080
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: tell us the business like background earlier. Okay, so let me let me help you rewrite your story like this

514
01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:52.790
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: when I am a product lead

515
01:19:53.070 --> 01:20:00.090
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: at Abcd Company. I'm responsible for launching. Can you fill me in the sentence? 5 words. What? What product.

516
01:20:00.863 --> 01:20:05.740
Vishal Bhoir: It's a analytics platform for grc, governance, risk and compliance.

517
01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:12.720
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay the governance risk and compliant, and any platform for government risk compliant product.

518
01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.990
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Then immediately down to A and B,

519
01:20:17.090 --> 01:20:20.650
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I had to reposition, a product from

520
01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:29.439
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: all in one place, end to end, risk management. Platform 2.

521
01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:38.989
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I don't know in individual module by module. Can you use 5 words describe your new thing. Do you call it module by module or individual, to tell me more.

522
01:20:38.990 --> 01:20:46.580
Vishal Bhoir: Yeah. So the Aa is like one stop shop for all the Grc analytics reporting

523
01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:51.219
Vishal Bhoir: all across different corporate function. But that didn't work because individual.

524
01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:58.649
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: No, no, no! Stop stop here, stop! Don't tell me, because from this to tell me to to what.

525
01:20:59.170 --> 01:21:05.359
Vishal Bhoir: 2 is like each each platform customized for individual function, corporate function.

526
01:21:06.613 --> 01:21:10.749
Vishal Bhoir: 1st line of defense, second line of defense, individual separate.

527
01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:21.320
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah to from all in all in one shop the end to all in one shop is for another, dashboard for all, everything, everything about

528
01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:31.590
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: for Gis government compliance, whatever stuff, risk management platform, too individualized

529
01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:35.930
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: product features that customized for individual users.

530
01:21:36.410 --> 01:21:38.780
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: they'll still meet the compliance needs.

531
01:21:39.670 --> 01:21:44.999
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Here is how, why, and how I reposition a product

532
01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:47.200
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and then add some background information.

533
01:21:47.330 --> 01:22:03.230
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: My company is the number one company who gives the compliance analytics dashboard for all the fortune, 500 companies. And then you add one more sentence. What does this mean? Gis, you know, and then you can one sentence

534
01:22:03.370 --> 01:22:11.860
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: all the fortune. 5 companies need to meet all the like compliance, legal requirements, such as taxes.

535
01:22:12.930 --> 01:22:20.310
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: labor law. I don't know what does mean international trade. And they're like, literally, there are

536
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:26.889
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: 100 different kind of like compliant things. All fortune companies need to follow.

537
01:22:28.131 --> 01:22:36.560
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: However, that's why we create all in one shop. You can track anything, all 100 different rules, always in one dashboard. Guess what?

538
01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:43.409
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Nobody used our product, or or within a year we'll only assign one customer.

539
01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:47.699
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: My company is about to go bankrupt if we don't fix the problem right away.

540
01:22:48.290 --> 01:22:52.140
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: so you make it more dramatic and easy for them to get it

541
01:22:53.010 --> 01:23:11.739
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: right. And then also, what do you mean? Gis? Right? And then there's like 100 different compliance taxes, labor unemployment like give them something random, but they have 100 of these. See how complex that's why, all in one. Whoa! Nobody buy it. Oh, like contrast.

542
01:23:11.930 --> 01:23:18.649
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: said, why do you even think nobody buy it. Oh, the interview I heard of say, Oh, yeah, yeah. I wonder what happened.

543
01:23:19.570 --> 01:23:21.409
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And here's how I fix it.

544
01:23:21.630 --> 01:23:41.020
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Number one. Now, when you say how to fix it. You say 1, 2, 3, you must put one. You don't have 1, 2, 3, you move it earlier, and then you say all the one to 3 number one. We look into the data what the heck is going on. Nobody want to buy it. Oh, the customer said, this reason number 2

545
01:23:41.450 --> 01:24:02.799
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: based on what they said. We decide to just break it down, redesign the business model, break it down by individual ones. Number 3. We redesign the Gtm. Strategy to sell the individual product and through I don't know. Upsell model. They buy one thing kind of cheap and then do another one and do another one. They end up paying more the lifetime value of customers

546
01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:09.609
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: as an example. Right? So make it simple. But but you make simple enough, just like you, you flip a little bit.

547
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:11.450
Vishal Bhoir: To make it more dramatic.

548
01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:12.440
Vishal Bhoir: Okay?

549
01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:15.089
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And they get it. Oh, so smart!

550
01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:17.030
Vishal Bhoir: 100 different things.

551
01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:32.759
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And then you all they buy one on, and they add it up. They end up paying more. Oh, okay, and also address whatever original concern. They want to buy everything in 1 1 shot together which is going to step number one. You try to understand why they don't want to buy everything altogether.

552
01:24:34.270 --> 01:24:35.090
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Hmm.

553
01:24:35.250 --> 01:24:42.750
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: The the context story is really good. The shift A to B was wow interesting.

554
01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.599
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: right? So say, more dramatic and flip something up front.

555
01:24:46.770 --> 01:24:58.090
Vishal Bhoir: Okay. So so the bottom line is like, you say the solution first, st and then describing detail how you reach out to that solution right?

556
01:24:58.090 --> 01:25:03.969
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, exactly, exactly. But it was one sentence upfront. You get a hook up front.

557
01:25:04.130 --> 01:25:10.509
Vishal Bhoir: Okay, okay, okay. I thought, like, build up story 1st and then say about the solution later on.

558
01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:11.490
Vishal Bhoir: No, no, okay.

559
01:25:11.490 --> 01:25:13.689
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: To the point G. Part of frameworks get to the point.

560
01:25:14.210 --> 01:25:17.309
Vishal Bhoir: Okay. Okay. Okay, okay. Sounds, good. Thank you.

561
01:25:17.310 --> 01:25:25.119
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Get to the point that will help you significantly. The story context is great. Just flip, flip the order a little bit

562
01:25:25.610 --> 01:25:31.919
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: cool. Cool. Okay. So now let's go to next question

563
01:25:32.990 --> 01:25:38.209
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: per launch framework, the 3 phases framework. I give a new name. I run it on a name. If you know.

564
01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:45.310
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: if you know better name, let me know. Okay, the I call that is for launch framework plf framework.

565
01:25:45.550 --> 01:25:48.480
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: 3 faces, because there's 3 faces

566
01:25:49.070 --> 01:26:15.659
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: or Iml framework ideation. Mvpl, Iml, like, yeah, if you don't, I mean, no, I want to give it a name. Okay, for now let's come 3 faces. I don't have any cool name or the cool name taken. Real framework. Gucci framework. Phd, my Cs Phd. Framework sounds cool. This one. I don't know if you know cooler names. Let me know. Okay. So now I want someone to go through this question.

567
01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:22.220
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Jen, I have a question. Your your hands are second.

568
01:26:23.970 --> 01:26:32.829
Jana Jiang: No, I don't have a question. I'm just just ready for this question, and realized I raised my hand too early, and they put it on.

569
01:26:33.126 --> 01:26:38.460
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay. But Sonny also raised before you. I think, sonny, did you have yours early for this one?

570
01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:44.739
Sunny Youn: I didn't raise. I had an example of repositioning. But it's okay.

571
01:26:45.208 --> 01:26:55.779
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: We have. If you have extra time, I'm going to go over yours. Okay, today, we have smaller class. We might have extra time. Let me go through. Let's go through each of the sample question first.st Okay?

572
01:26:58.410 --> 01:26:59.710
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: None. Let's go.

573
01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:08.989
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Tell me. Oh, oh, everybody launch 3 min. This one can go to 3 min, 3, 3 min, and then.

574
01:27:09.490 --> 01:27:10.140
Jana Jiang: Hmm.

575
01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:16.580
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Ideation. Mvp. Launch. You must tell them upfront. You have 3 phases.

576
01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:21.569
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Then you tell them what exactly happened in ideation, phase and Mmp. And launch.

577
01:27:21.670 --> 01:27:25.730
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It should be straightforward. Okay, 3 faces. Okay, let's go.

578
01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:27.390
Jana Jiang: 3 min.

579
01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:34.429
Jana Jiang: I'm gonna tell about. I'm gonna talk about the project called Facebook Cappy Project

580
01:27:34.896 --> 01:28:03.950
Jana Jiang: I was hired by marketing analytic team as a data product manager to optimize the ad performance at Textile. One of the biggest problem with ad optimization is that the return on ad spend is relatively low, and they have tried many initiatives, and nothing seems to work effectively. So it was a very challenging test, and it's, in fact, the whole revenue of the

581
01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:05.639
Jana Jiang: as

582
01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:13.419
Jana Jiang: the whole whole revenue of the spin and the 1st time. And it's also the 1st time we try to optimize

583
01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:18.880
Jana Jiang: ads from the business side connect the business side as well as the technical side.

584
01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:29.000
Jana Jiang: So when I took on this task, I used the 3 phase approach phase, one ideation phase 2 Mvp and phase 3. Product launch.

585
01:28:29.050 --> 01:28:46.530
Jana Jiang: In the 1st phase I look into how textile, optimized as today and what other alternative solution they had tried. I talked to every stakeholder during this whole process, from engineering to data, scientists to analyst, to understand the customer need and the pain point.

586
01:28:46.540 --> 01:29:06.070
Jana Jiang: I was surprised to find out that textile manually sending important conversion events like order, complete and complete registration to Facebook to optimize our ad performance on Facebook advertising platform from server to server, which requires several resting places. Each resting places

587
01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:27.899
Jana Jiang: require certain manipulation to put data in motion, which, causing data, refreshness, always 3 h delay and 20 min interval time. We also realized we required average 5 h per week from data engineering team to support and resolve the latency from the this integration.

588
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:43.149
Jana Jiang: Knowing this great insight, I started to brainstorm some ideas, to fix this urgent case. One of the idea we had was to use segment segment interface to the feeding process and automatically sending.

589
01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:47.139
Jana Jiang: sending the conversion event to Facebook.

590
01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:52.999
Jana Jiang: So we can had. We can have real time. Conversion rates sent into Facebook

591
01:29:53.160 --> 01:30:13.450
Jana Jiang: in phase 2. I worked with engineering team to create Mvp. Using profile Api and a destination insert function in segment Ui to automate this copy process. Meanwhile I had a frequently meeting frequent meeting with our stakeholder to seek their feedback and prioritize use cases

592
01:30:13.530 --> 01:30:23.413
Jana Jiang: in Phase 3. We started to text out the new process by comparing the new data with the old the data, sending with the new process.

593
01:30:24.397 --> 01:30:41.679
Jana Jiang: worse. Compared to the data with sending with an old process, it proven that we have more than 99% accuracy. But instead, 3 h delay and 20 min interpret. Time is old process. The new process is able to sending the data in real time.

594
01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:54.829
Jana Jiang: As a result, the conversion rate started to increase. After one month deployed this new process. The return on Ad. Spend increased by 20% after one month, deploy this product.

595
01:30:56.526 --> 01:31:01.000
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Very good. Actually, I want to use Browning ads

596
01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:08.169
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: right now. Very painful. Okay, anyone have ads experience. I give you login to Pma ads right now.

597
01:31:08.650 --> 01:31:10.756
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: anyway. Cool.

598
01:31:13.090 --> 01:31:14.010
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Go backwards.

599
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:26.800
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Gtm, gtm's gtm, part is missing a bit.

600
01:31:27.450 --> 01:31:35.699
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You said, Oh, after you implement this? Oh, yeah, you didn't tell us how you launch it. Is it? Is it internal product? You just hit the button launch.

601
01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:59.780
Jana Jiang: It's an internal product. And and we hold on the new process. And we compare we, we literally using the old process to sending the same amount of same amount of data, and then we use the new process to sending the same amount data without sending really sending it. We just use the process that didn't real send to the Facebook. And we compare these 2 data.

602
01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:12.670
Jana Jiang: and we just like to make sure the accuracy. The accuracy is more than 99%. And then, after we confirm the accuracy, we launch the new process.

603
01:32:12.890 --> 01:32:17.940
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So when you launch after you run a B testing, when you launch is a push, a button and you flip right.

604
01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:19.840
Jana Jiang: Yes, yes.

605
01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:24.639
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, cool. In that case, move it. You call the launch. During the launch process

606
01:32:25.650 --> 01:32:32.670
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: we decide to do a B testing to verify if this brand new Api-based process is better than manual or not.

607
01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:38.349
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: we decide we design ab ab experimentation like this.

608
01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:51.260
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: We have our old process manual process and into Facebook ads versus the new process which is using api integration. And then we do after the comparison, when 99% accuracy

609
01:32:51.400 --> 01:33:03.630
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: result, 3 h delay 20 min interval. They clearly are much better options. So was after we had a full confidence, and we decide to launch this feature to all the customers.

610
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:07.869
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And and then we, with with the help of the engineering team.

611
01:33:09.180 --> 01:33:12.600
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So you can, you can describe that way. Okay,

612
01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:25.979
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: yeah. Move. Ab, A, B, 10 is your launch phase. And then the impact's great and actually like it. You're a little bit over time. It was the beginning. I think you spend lots of time talking about.

613
01:33:26.890 --> 01:33:30.490
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Other things that's not very memorable.

614
01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:33.590
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You can make it short of whatever you wrote

615
01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:36.619
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: before you talk about the specific 3 phases.

616
01:33:37.010 --> 01:33:46.069
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You can make the sentence remove one or 2 sentences from the original bulk. Things you wrote because it's not memorable, not memorable means. It's not necessary.

617
01:33:46.170 --> 01:34:09.850
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Some of these are not necessary. You can just directly say, when I was working for an AI product lead at Abcd Company, I was responsible for launching this Abcd product, and whatever from scratch to help as conversion, they make it simple and then go to one to 3 faster. Whatever sentences you basically, you can remove a few of these. That's my point.

618
01:34:09.850 --> 01:34:18.260
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You should write down what you have. Figure out what one or 2 sentences you can remove. So you get to the point faster, and the rest is good to switch what you had earlier.

619
01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:36.639
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Cool. This is good. This is good. Yeah, I like it. Cool. Yeah, everybody learned this as a good example. I think she implement the framework very well, just a very, very beginning, she said. A little bit too much minimum is fine. Okay, so launch.

620
01:34:37.810 --> 01:34:45.040
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: it's an internal product. So therefore, her launch process different. If you launch anything that to external customer.

621
01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:48.040
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you must describe a Gtm. Strategy.

622
01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:49.949
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: We'll talk about Gtm in Module 4.

623
01:34:50.580 --> 01:35:09.430
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, I can describe something like, Oh, we launched a Beta tester first, st or we launch to ABC. Location customer. First.st Once they great, we launch to something else. So like Gtn strategy, or we decide to do organic content marketing to drive early adopters. And then we start to do

624
01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:27.569
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: influencer marketing. We started what type of fundamental funnel bottom funnel any kind of Gtm strategies and framework, and put it here into different, like different layers, different phases. We do this 1st and then this. When I see success, we launch it to second phase, and we implement 3rd phase or launching process, because usually we launch something.

625
01:35:27.610 --> 01:35:29.770
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Los Kami does not just say.

626
01:35:30.370 --> 01:35:35.370
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: hit a button, push everybody in the world. They do one wave different waves of launching.

627
01:35:35.670 --> 01:35:41.949
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, this for external comment. Internal customer. The way she described is fine. Okay? Cool. Jack. Question.

628
01:35:41.950 --> 01:35:52.159
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Yeah, I have a quick question regarding the Gtm strategy, because, like like, you mentioned, like some products are internal. In that case, how would we?

629
01:35:53.242 --> 01:36:20.369
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: what's the optimal way to describe the Gtm cause like for my specific one? You know, we launch. We. We hold an internal meeting to launch the product to our internal customer, and then we have like office hours to teach them how to use the product but that's it like, that's not like a complete Gtm product like it, like, you know, external customer and stuff. What would be the best way to describe that kind of internal product. Gtm process.

630
01:36:20.370 --> 01:36:31.429
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: If you can break a launch process into different phases will be great. For example, phase one. Test out with one sales rep, works so well, and then let's launch it to everybody.

631
01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:47.229
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and then, after you launch it, we also manage end-to-end lifecycle process, which is like, Oh, which is like, continue to do Q. And a office hours continue to teach them how to do it as example. Right? So we want to hear different steps.

632
01:36:47.570 --> 01:36:57.630
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Ideally, you have. We test out with one people first.st It's always come with one or 2, maybe 3. I don't know beta same thing as Beta test equals or other people's Beta testing.

633
01:36:59.170 --> 01:37:00.460
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Got it. Thank you so much.

634
01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:07.509
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Hmm, no problem. Cool. Great question. Okay. So now, for the sake of time, let me go through all the questions first, st and we can go through other

635
01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:15.479
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Other questions we didn't get or want to repeat. Okay, cool. So very 2 frameworks straightforward.

636
01:37:15.770 --> 01:37:19.890
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: By the way, guys just stick to the framework very powerful.

637
01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:23.670
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay. So all my framework very simple.

638
01:37:23.950 --> 01:37:26.939
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: but very powerful, easy to use.

639
01:37:27.090 --> 01:37:35.900
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Sweet bullet point 2 sentences per bullet point. Each bullet point has one summary and one supporting point.

640
01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:43.140
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, so 3 by 2 straightforward 6 sentences in total, this is very suitable.

641
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:49.056
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: 4. So that I have the detailed description of. I watch my prep training.

642
01:37:52.340 --> 01:37:58.279
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: very simple. How you for things like, how do you prioritize part features?

643
01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:04.720
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Why do you want to do something? It's so good. Okay? So now, the only exception is

644
01:38:05.140 --> 01:38:10.939
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: sometimes 3 by 2, 3 bullet point right? Sometimes there's some steps that more than 3 can do, 4 by 2,

645
01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:19.299
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: 5 by 2, something like that. Okay? So now, regarding prioritize for features actually have 5 key points I want to touch.

646
01:38:19.590 --> 01:38:25.709
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, so now let me let me show you how to do this question, how do you prioritize product? Features?

647
01:38:26.030 --> 01:38:35.340
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Many things going into it. Number one, let me go through the framework. First, st you guys can plug in. We want to understand why building these features. Are we solving the right problem

648
01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:42.660
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: that we need? We need to Match Company Goals Company Mission and what customer wants?

649
01:38:43.410 --> 01:38:44.130
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay?

650
01:38:44.970 --> 01:38:46.590
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Number 2,

651
01:38:46.890 --> 01:38:53.339
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: how do you feel as a company? Whatever we want to building is actually meeting the goal of the company. Let's be specific.

652
01:38:53.550 --> 01:39:03.570
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Let's create the the entire, the we create a matrix that has the grid goes into

653
01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:11.189
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you match customer pain, point, engineering effort, urgency and risk. All this

654
01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:16.570
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: goes into like a matrix. Sorry. It's a kind of matrix going into a matrix.

655
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:21.060
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And in the matrix that has scoring systems.

656
01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:26.330
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, so that's the answer. Oh, this is higher, this is lower. This is all of this

657
01:39:26.490 --> 01:39:28.429
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: right? And then

658
01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:41.640
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you put all the low, high, medium low, different things on a roadmap, and understand how they compare with company goals, and also with the success metric with Kpi for all those products.

659
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:47.719
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Then it also groups them into different Mvp. Mmp. And launch process

660
01:39:50.680 --> 01:40:01.439
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: to to continuously enhance and update your product, roadmap and features and test out the ideas

661
01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:04.140
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: for each of the Mmp

662
01:40:04.250 --> 01:40:11.829
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and Mnp and launch, because each time you launch you collect feedback and continuously update and reprioritize the prod feature. So it's a loop.

663
01:40:13.010 --> 01:40:16.100
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, so, but we hit those keywords I put here.

664
01:40:18.670 --> 01:40:22.759
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, so I need. And then we go through this.

665
01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:31.490
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: We need to add some simple explanation of your product

666
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:36.019
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: past product. Name here, instead of talking about

667
01:40:36.210 --> 01:40:38.280
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: like the keywords I put here.

668
01:40:39.600 --> 01:41:00.509
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, for example, if I go through this question I'll be talking about. Yes, I can show you how to prioritize features. Do you mind? I use my smart cities product as an example when I tell you about my methodology, interview, frequency and no problem. Go ahead. Well, 1st of all.

669
01:41:00.770 --> 01:41:05.609
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I need to understand. Why are we building these features? Are we solving the right problem.

670
01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:11.480
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: For example, when I create my smart cities product

671
01:41:13.010 --> 01:41:16.939
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: that use AI to help cities reduce car crashes.

672
01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:27.830
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: we need to look up the existing like product. 10 different features reduce car crashes? Are all those features actually in alignment of company's goals and mission

673
01:41:27.950 --> 01:41:32.119
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: which our mission, literally helping cities reduce car crashes save people's lives.

674
01:41:32.340 --> 01:41:38.089
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Now, all the features actually is meeting. That goes right. They're all very important.

675
01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:59.990
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: cool. In that case we pass the 1st part, and then we create a matrix. The matrix had a very comprehensive like, key thing goes into it, including customer pain point, need design, engineering effort, urgency and risk. All of these. Then we put all different features again, those matrix. Okay, so that, for example, will turn out, is

676
01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:03.530
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: like running a red light

677
01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:18.910
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: like literally is the highest. Once you rank all of them highest engineering effort, like lowest engineer effort, highest urgency, highest risk. But whatever lowest risk, whatever different numbers you plug in and

678
01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:31.909
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: like to follow by like jaywalking, and near, misses all those key features, and then continue to run the same entire matrix against all possible different kind of features.

679
01:42:32.010 --> 01:42:41.069
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: They brought all of these together. I was able to give them the scoring systems, and then put them on a roadmap that makes, and then, whatever continue to say, okay, so

680
01:42:41.190 --> 01:42:44.699
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: my point did you notice, is the same keywords here.

681
01:42:45.010 --> 01:42:49.889
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But I also use my specific product, which is smart cities

682
01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:56.300
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: product as an example to walk people through this product so that it doesn't feel very boring

683
01:42:57.090 --> 01:43:20.309
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and very complex for them to get what's going on, and also help them to understand empathy, such as running red light, jaywalking near, misses different kind of key features, and and you can put on romance to be oh, no wonder this is highest. Oh, running red light is highest. Okay, cool makes sense. And all of those right. So plug in some of the real life

684
01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:32.029
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: name, a product, real life features. Some of these high, level things. Walk them through the process. Okay, cool. Let me pick a 1 here. Do we have a volunteer to go through. How you prioritize the product features.

685
01:43:37.970 --> 01:43:40.389
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: If not, let me let me pick someone random

686
01:43:46.599 --> 01:43:55.109
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: let me pick someone potentially can in arsenal.

687
01:43:58.610 --> 01:43:59.550
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Hello.

688
01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:01.040
Arslan.: Identity.

689
01:44:01.590 --> 01:44:07.120
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Hello! So can you? You should be able to do this very well.

690
01:44:09.130 --> 01:44:10.150
Arslan.: Can you hear me? Okay. Now.

691
01:44:10.450 --> 01:44:13.790
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yes, yes, I can hear you. Can you help me?

692
01:44:15.950 --> 01:44:17.929
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Can you answer this interview? Question?

693
01:44:18.230 --> 01:44:29.040
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: How do you prioritize product features? This is my last interview question. You have 2 min. I give you my high level example. Those are all the keywords. Can you tell me what your answer is?

694
01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:31.560
Arslan.: Yeah. So I'm just gonna

695
01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:41.579
Arslan.: come up with that answer on the fly, because I'm not prepared for that yet, but based on what you just said so. Thanks for the asking that question. So when

696
01:44:42.066 --> 01:44:53.669
Arslan.: whenever we are building the product, the 1st thing that I would look at it is to make sure that we are solving the right problem by keeping the right

697
01:44:54.142 --> 01:45:14.109
Arslan.: user in mind and understanding that if you're solving the right pain points for that. So in that situation, I can share a few examples with you in the past where I have I've been working with engineering team and other product managers. And while we are building those features, the 1st thing we do is to

698
01:45:14.130 --> 01:45:29.969
Arslan.: understand the customers, their pain points and their needs, and then build a very comprehensive matrix with engineering effort. The urgency of the customer needs as well as the risk for the business on that.

699
01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:46.450
Arslan.: And then we use that metrics to put them in a scorecard that helps us understand and make a data driven decision on which features to be prioritized in alignment with company goals, and the product apis as well.

700
01:45:46.600 --> 01:46:09.259
Arslan.: And then we use that except that that scorecard into 3 key phases of those features. One, of course, is during the development phase. But then, after that, it's the minimum viable product, the minimal marketable product. And then how do we launch it? And then we expect

701
01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:19.350
Arslan.: those features to keep on churning, as we keep on building those features as either an enhancement or new feature. Keep on adding into that list.

702
01:46:20.210 --> 01:46:30.900
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Very good. Okay. I want you. You did very well. You wrote it. Very well. It comes in the fly. Very well, very good. Actually okay, very good. Almost pass the interview.

703
01:46:31.540 --> 01:46:35.060
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: adding your prime name for me. Can you add your prime name for me?

704
01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:39.539
Arslan.: Yeah, I can. I can add the product that that for example, when I was.

705
01:46:39.540 --> 01:46:41.300
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Using examples yeah.

706
01:46:41.300 --> 01:47:07.280
Arslan.: Yeah, yeah, when I was working at Oracle. I was responsible for the networking product line. And one of the product that I was deeply involved was the fast connect which was connecting the customer data center with the public cloud. So in that there were various aspects and dependencies of that feature with the networking product line, the compute product line and the storage.

707
01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:15.879
Arslan.: and each one of them have their own risks as well as urgency from different customer needs.

708
01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:19.970
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Good.

709
01:47:19.970 --> 01:47:21.140
Arslan.: Should I add more detail.

710
01:47:21.710 --> 01:47:29.400
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: No, no, no, no! Let me show you guys how to add the right amount of detail. That's that's right. That's right. Details you had already right.

711
01:47:29.540 --> 01:47:34.830
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And for I'm trying to integrate whatever oracle Apc things together.

712
01:47:36.430 --> 01:47:45.460
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And it turned out that at 1st we value all the features that's matching the company missions and then face them. In the second step

713
01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:53.340
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I put into I put all the features into a matrix comparing the customer pain, point, engineering, time, effort and urgency, and risk

714
01:47:53.490 --> 01:47:57.170
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: what it turned out. Give me the top 3 features.

715
01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:02.810
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Can you give me some names? Give give me some some something, give me something. Then put in sentence.

716
01:48:02.810 --> 01:48:15.249
Arslan.: Yep, yep. It turned out that the most important feature was the security list as well as the integration with the data center fabric. As a 2 major key points for that feature.

717
01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:21.076
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Perfect after yeah, yeah. And then

718
01:48:21.780 --> 01:48:33.669
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: well, I forgot to mention putting them into a scoring system. And it turned out, those are top 3 features after the scoring systems, and then you say, one more sentence, and then I continue

719
01:48:34.130 --> 01:48:42.220
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: 2 rank, all other 10 features, and

720
01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:51.329
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: after rank, all of them. I put them into a prime roadmap based on all the priorities we just had and comparement company goals and set Kpi for each of features.

721
01:48:51.430 --> 01:49:09.299
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Then I put them into 3 phases like Mep. Mmp. And launch, and they continue to say, which is that which is a very good, very smooth. Actually, it's very good. Okay, just be specific. Hey, guys, what he had is perfect. Let's rehab. I'm going to cut off the session as a sample

722
01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:12.619
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: coaching for this interview. Actually, it's perfect

723
01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:21.109
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: how he wrote off the script, using all the keywords we gave him. Perfect. Let's read perfect. We just need to

724
01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:24.150
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: add some customer empathy.

725
01:49:24.530 --> 01:49:36.350
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: because all of you guys can watch my recordings, memorize exact things, I said. But I don't all. I don't want my all my students say exactly what I said, because I want arson to say what he said.

726
01:49:36.460 --> 01:49:38.189
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Sunny said, what she said.

727
01:49:38.950 --> 01:49:40.950
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Jack said what he said as well.

728
01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:47.809
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So how you do that is, you sprinkle in the type of product arsenal said

729
01:49:48.480 --> 01:50:06.220
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: he was doing oracle, working on whether one just one of the largest site integration between this and this. With that we have. Well, I need to prioritize all the top 10 features. I will put them into the matrix. We we list out right here, or we turn out

730
01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:18.500
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: the top. 3 features dot dot are the highest after we put them in a scoring system right? So it rose better and show his authorities in the space.

731
01:50:19.090 --> 01:50:34.919
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and also sounds like, Oh, you work on such complicated things. Oh, yeah, no wonder, for oracle whatever ABC thing has 10 different things. Wow! That sounds very complex. And you're able to process so many different things for cloud migration, for oracle, or using this

732
01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:52.559
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: comprehensive thinking methodology. That sounds a good job, that kind of feeling. Okay, so sprinkle the name of your product. But I'm going to cut it into a sample sample coaching for for the specific interview question. Okay? Good job. Good job. Arson. How you wrote it. Okay, is this clear to everybody how you sprinkle

733
01:50:52.700 --> 01:50:58.320
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: the name of your product and sprinkle some some top, 3 features.

734
01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:01.750
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: sprinkle some things in it. Is it clear to everybody?

735
01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:14.520
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Good. Okay, perfect. But but how? He rolls to say, let's rerolling all the keywords here, you you're good. This looks very well. Just say, sprinkle something. Okay. So you guys are good, cool, right?

736
01:51:15.180 --> 01:51:20.729
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Why do you wanna be on Pm, straightforward? Let me pick someone entry level

737
01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:26.190
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: to answer this easier question. Okay, I want people speak up a little bit in my class.

738
01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:30.250
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Tanya.

739
01:51:31.890 --> 01:51:35.420
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Say things shown concise. Oh, you raise your hand before I call you.

740
01:51:36.342 --> 01:51:37.639
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Remind things alike.

741
01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:58.220
Tanya Milton: Question. Actually, I really was listening to you and on the framework. But I just wanted to check. Do we have to also add the rice framework, because generally we do either Moscow or rice. So I was just thinking that to be more specific on, how do I prioritize? So? Yes, some great answers here.

742
01:51:58.220 --> 01:51:58.630
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay.

743
01:51:58.630 --> 01:52:18.000
Tanya Milton: What I in my answer, which I don't remember by heart, but I have it written. I kind of use the circle framework which you mentioned last time. No, it's not the best one. But I think for me to come to the point that how am I cutting through the prioritization? Do we have to use the rice framework? Do we have to call it out or no, like.

744
01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:24.619
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: No rice framework is not used for prioritization. Rice framework is, do the Kpi.

745
01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:27.520
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Right. And

746
01:52:27.910 --> 01:52:46.250
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: the whatever other framework Moscow means must to have good to have right a should have, must have should have, which is right here. So basically, after you put in a scoring system, you can put a must have a should have. You can do that. But I wouldn't do that.

747
01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:50.840
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: because after you do the scoring system, even if you must have good half.

748
01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:57.609
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It's still the end. Let's say you have 5 must have features that will go into Mvp.

749
01:52:58.860 --> 01:53:03.089
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But priority proficiaries means among those 5 which one do I work on first? st

750
01:53:06.830 --> 01:53:10.619
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Right? So therefore I would rather we talk about

751
01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:21.259
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: like we put them in a scoring system. Then I know this is number one, number 2, and then the rest will continue. Then obviously, it's a score, 1, 2, 3, 4, and then there's a row map.

752
01:53:22.050 --> 01:53:32.999
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and then we understand all the features. What are the Kpis? You don't need to say we use right framework to identify the Kpi. I think this is because it's not this about prioritizing.

753
01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:36.080
Tanya Milton: It's not about. What do you set as a kpi.

754
01:53:36.270 --> 01:53:42.530
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So it's not necessary. Right? So it's more about prioritize 10 different things on your product roadmap.

755
01:53:44.070 --> 01:54:10.619
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But good question clearly studied very hard on my framework not necessary. If they ask you, how would how would you set Kpi for your product? Yeah, I use rice framework, but don't say that I use rice framework. You say I consider RICE. Right like that. But but don't say that I use right framework. Same thing to make it rose better like how arson did a really good job about how he rolls off the keywords here to make it like a thing.

756
01:54:11.180 --> 01:54:18.820
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It's good. It's good. Just roll off a little better. But the key concept you just hit all the key concept here you can pass into me.

757
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:37.219
Tanya Milton: Sure. Sure, Dr. Nancy, so additional question which the my challenge with what I'm facing is my, I'm from Hr. Tech background. I think my product was not as complex as core technical, like, I've been hearing other people here. So I think my problem is different. Just opposite, I think I'm talking very generic.

758
01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:59.739
Tanya Milton: and then I need to strike a right balance. So I think that's my like, say, for example, I'll just talk about my product, which is like, how do you prioritize your how did you prioritize? How do you generally prioritize? So I have a little bit stuff written here which I can just quickly read, and then you can guide me so I would love to use an example. One of the product I launched.

759
01:54:59.740 --> 01:55:06.199
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: No, no, I want you to answer why you want to be a Pm, we have extra time. We can talk about other like prioritization.

760
01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:08.300
Tanya Milton: Okay, fine. So we are to the next one. Okay.

761
01:55:08.300 --> 01:55:10.489
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Why do you want to become pm.

762
01:55:10.710 --> 01:55:11.210
Tanya Milton: Oh, I'll.

763
01:55:11.210 --> 01:55:13.969
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Do you have? Do you have any kind of answers ready.

764
01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:19.477
Tanya Milton: In my mind. Yes, I think so, but I think I can quickly.

765
01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:20.840
Tanya Milton: 10.

766
01:55:21.660 --> 01:55:23.039
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Who has answered to this.

767
01:55:23.358 --> 01:55:27.181
Tanya Milton: Can give an attempt, though, like if you don't mind like

768
01:55:27.748 --> 01:55:33.469
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Let me see who else have the answer you can. I want people prepared anyone to answer this. You can do virtual hand.

769
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:35.510
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: I can. I can answer.

770
01:55:37.230 --> 01:55:40.090
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You guys already spoke. Okay, let me pick someone else. Sorry.

771
01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:43.615
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, I see who is sleeping in my class.

772
01:55:45.237 --> 01:55:49.680
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Tanya, get ready for your next one. What sets you apart from other candidates?

773
01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:52.330
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, you will go for this one.

774
01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:54.600
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, let me pick someone else.

775
01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:00.190
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, who hasn't spoken yet.

776
01:56:04.730 --> 01:56:08.149
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Ashwaya, why do you want to be a Pm.

01:56:44.996 --> 01:56:49.980
明月 yang: Let me open and turn on my okay.

786
01:56:51.170 --> 01:56:52.930
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Why do you want to become a Pm.

787
01:56:53.850 --> 01:56:54.270
明月 yang: So.

788
01:56:54.270 --> 01:56:59.459
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Those again. You don't need to pick everything here. Those are inspiration. Okay, go ahead.

789
01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:01.075
明月 yang: Oh,

790
01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:09.530
明月 yang: I want to. I want to become a I want to be a product manager is because I want to.

791
01:57:11.070 --> 01:57:19.869
明月 yang: I want to design a product from concept to final launch. Which is a

792
01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:43.160
明月 yang: which is a which is a product, that customer love a lot. And I think I have great customer empathy because I have a psychology background. And I also really love to do customer intervals during my previous working as a product manager.

793
01:57:43.290 --> 01:57:51.090
明月 yang: and I know the responsibility of the this job. And then also

794
01:57:54.360 --> 01:58:00.610
明月 yang: I I also. I also enjoy to be the CEO of the product.

795
01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:08.800
明月 yang: And I think I'm really good at communication with it with other stakeholders. And I

796
01:58:08.980 --> 01:58:19.650
明月 yang: really in dry to work with cross functional teams and also lead others to complete one product.

797
01:58:19.910 --> 01:58:27.560
明月 yang: and I think my personality is outgoing, and I have.

798
01:58:27.960 --> 01:58:35.670
明月 yang: and the resilient, and when I face to, when I face a challenge I will think of.

799
01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:39.870
明月 yang: Come up a lot of solutions to it and

800
01:58:41.272 --> 01:58:45.790
明月 yang: lead the whole team to a successful product launch.

801
01:58:48.020 --> 01:58:56.200
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Not organized, but your your rationale is good. Okay? So now let me show you guys how to

802
01:58:56.720 --> 01:59:05.008
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: answer this. Okay, and your original good, your original thought process good. I know you guys are not prepared. Your original thought process is good.

803
01:59:06.627 --> 01:59:08.570
明月 yang: Didn't prepare this.

804
01:59:08.570 --> 01:59:26.252
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, I just want to show you how to add one more sentence behind it. Her original talking point is fine. She was like, oh, I want to see a product from concept execution end to end. And I also love to see customer empathy. I'm also very outgoing person. Many different things right?

805
01:59:27.230 --> 01:59:34.849
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: What you said is good. The reason you pick is good. Supporting point wasn't strong.

806
01:59:35.460 --> 01:59:42.019
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You said, Oh, why do you want to become? I want to see things from from 0 to one end to end of product launch

807
01:59:42.170 --> 01:59:46.439
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: concept, execution. I want you to say one more thing. Why why matters to you.

808
01:59:47.260 --> 01:59:57.809
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You can describe this way because I love to see something from concept execution 0 to one, because I'm somebody who want to see bigger pictures

809
01:59:58.140 --> 01:59:59.620
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: for hours.

810
02:00:00.203 --> 02:00:03.189
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Not only a build, one piece of things.

811
02:00:03.690 --> 02:00:15.720
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I want to see how my, how product was built and eventually impact people's lives. This end-to-end experience made me a more holistic person and also holistic leader in the long run. As well.

812
02:00:16.760 --> 02:00:18.050
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Number 2.

813
02:00:18.450 --> 02:00:21.080
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And what's your number 2? I forgot. What's your number 2?

814
02:00:22.325 --> 02:00:23.480
明月 yang: The customer empathy.

815
02:00:23.480 --> 02:00:29.729
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah. Customer empathy number 2, customer empathy. I have very strong customer empathy. I love

816
02:00:29.930 --> 02:00:38.700
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: understanding customer needs and pain point and solve problems for them. Then, with a supporting point, why do you think you have very strong customer empathy.

817
02:00:40.150 --> 02:01:00.320
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: for example, if me, if I go out for interview again. If they show that I have very strong customer embassy, I will say this. Whatever I love, understand the customer pain point. I love solving problems for them. For example, when I create my own coaching program during my maternity leave

818
02:01:00.450 --> 02:01:03.610
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I talked to over 300

819
02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:12.219
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: aspiring prime managers and existing prime managers really try to understand. What exactly are they missing? What they don't have?

820
02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:15.550
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I know the number sounds really high, but

821
02:01:16.170 --> 02:01:30.969
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I each of them is sharing me the unique pain point to help me to really deeply understand why they need what kind of help, so that I can create the best product in the market to serve the needs

822
02:01:31.550 --> 02:01:35.750
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: certain right, and it was some kind of supporting point.

823
02:01:35.990 --> 02:01:49.280
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: or you can do a generic one will have very strong customer empathy. You say you can describe each time for all the product build in the past. I'm the one who always want to talk to like at least 20 different customers to understand their needs

824
02:01:49.430 --> 02:01:57.399
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: so that I can create the best product, have filled their pain and solve their problem from their perspective.

825
02:01:58.030 --> 02:02:00.820
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It's like, you know some kind of supporting point.

826
02:02:01.260 --> 02:02:10.410
明月 yang: Okay. So for each point, I need to see why I'm I'm good. And also I give a example of that.

827
02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:12.090
明月 yang: Okay.

828
02:02:12.090 --> 02:02:15.010
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Exactly why you like it and why you're good.

829
02:02:15.490 --> 02:02:18.100
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: why, you can do the job as example.

830
02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:18.800
明月 yang: Okay.

831
02:02:19.152 --> 02:02:24.790
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Great cool. Let me go back to the what's such? A powerful e, slow down e.

832
02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:27.669
Ankita Bhargava: Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!

833
02:02:27.670 --> 02:02:30.950
Ankita Bhargava: See this. This question about product manager is.

834
02:02:31.350 --> 02:02:34.799
Ankita Bhargava: People who are aspiring to be product managers essentially.

835
02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:36.370
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: No.

836
02:02:36.530 --> 02:02:37.490
Ankita Bhargava: Okay. Okay.

837
02:02:37.490 --> 02:02:40.120
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Hold on! Hold on! Hold on! Hold on! Hold on! Slow down!

838
02:02:45.390 --> 02:02:50.870
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I was asked this question before, but they modified the question for me. Let me think about how exactly

839
02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:06.279
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I think they asked me question. I think they pivot the question into what do you like, and not like about Pm.

840
02:03:06.830 --> 02:03:08.749
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: For for existing. Pm.

841
02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:12.220
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I see and pivot into this one.

842
02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:16.629
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: If you're transitioning, they will ask you this question, why do you want to become Pm.

843
02:03:17.535 --> 02:03:19.159
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But they make it like

844
02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:30.509
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: we like. Listen worst about pm, but even a senior Pm. They probably won't ask you, why do you want to become a Pm. Or they'll ask you, why do you want to be a Pm.

845
02:03:32.020 --> 02:03:36.129
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Why, you choose this profession like those kind of things? If a sub engineer.

846
02:03:37.070 --> 02:03:40.859
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: what? Your Senior self engineer, what? Why do you even want to

847
02:03:41.160 --> 02:03:47.559
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: start a software engineer career? Why do you want to be a software engineer, some something, those kind of directions. Okay, still be prepared.

848
02:03:48.260 --> 02:03:53.300
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So be prepared. Okay, great question. What did you perform as a candidate? Tanya.

849
02:03:57.750 --> 02:04:06.789
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: okay, I want to elaborate this quickly again. I give you some potential keywords you can pick from 3 by 2. You don't need to use all of this if you don't think it's

850
02:04:06.970 --> 02:04:11.171
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: like it's helping you to be who you are.

851
02:04:12.700 --> 02:04:15.729
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But understand, this is my size interview question.

852
02:04:15.970 --> 02:04:18.010
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Even if they don't ask you

853
02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:20.659
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: the same way I put it here.

854
02:04:21.290 --> 02:04:22.860
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You need some answer ready.

855
02:04:23.670 --> 02:04:30.869
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: The the recruiters and hiring managers is asking them this question when they're talking to you.

867
02:05:36.260 --> 02:05:39.550
Tanya Milton: opportunities, because I'm a perfect combination of

868
02:05:39.730 --> 02:05:59.140
Tanya Milton: having a technical mindset. And also I have experience of the business side of it just to let you know I have. I'm from Hr. Tech background. So I have worked as a Hr. Have been there, I as a customer, and I very well know their pain points.

869
02:05:59.150 --> 02:06:18.069
Tanya Milton: I've been there so that helps me to relate to the actual pain point of the customer. So that gives me a thinking mindset where I can actually have a problem solving approach towards any product I am building. And of course, my product management skills, which is my

870
02:06:18.070 --> 02:06:42.859
Tanya Milton: technical knowledge. And I can say that I'm an expert in process automation. I've worked on various workflow automation and launching product from concept to execution. In fact, even a post launch support like adoption, toolkit. And how you deal with how do you deal with the customers and

871
02:06:42.860 --> 02:06:52.499
Tanya Milton: and the employee after the product is launched. So I have seen pretty much both the sides, and that's why I think I'm a great fit.

872
02:06:52.660 --> 02:07:17.860
Tanya Milton: And again. I've worked with software engineers in a scrum team. I've worked with software engineers, designers and Bas and the leadership team. So that's pretty much my everyday communication happens with the team. So yes, I think I've seen every bit of it. The aspects which is there in the product management role.

879
02:07:44.860 --> 02:07:51.959
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Tanya herself. She's Hr. Before Hr. Tech. She was not technical, as she said earlier herself.

880
02:07:52.180 --> 02:07:56.250
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: but she was able to create something. Sounds like legit.

881
02:07:57.090 --> 02:08:05.480
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, I not have new business. I I do something like, I love things end to end like what is sounds rigid.

02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:34.509
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Giving your background. Create answer like this, actually great. Actually, this is great. Okay, very good at process automation whatever which is true is stay true to her also, something like, Oh, cool. You're you're really strong in Hr tech. You say, yeah, I'm good on. Hr tech. Yeah. Someone else come from us and work on

885
02:08:35.480 --> 02:08:44.040
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oracle Cloud. He doesn't know. Hr. Tech. I do right as example. I think it's good. You create a really good answer. I don't want to change

886
02:08:44.410 --> 02:08:49.209
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: much. Seriously. I I don't even know how to change it. I I think it's good. Okay.

887
02:08:49.210 --> 02:08:51.020
Tanya Milton: Need to learn to speak

888
02:08:51.380 --> 02:08:58.090
Tanya Milton: fluently, and I think I'm that's why I'm learning. Because I think I it's hard for me to memorize. And

889
02:08:58.210 --> 02:09:05.659
Tanya Milton: so that's not, I'm having hard time talking with speed. So yeah, I'm learning. I think I'll get there.

890
02:09:07.420 --> 02:09:07.900
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Thank you.

891
02:09:07.900 --> 02:09:09.799

893
02:09:16.350 --> 02:09:21.880
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I time I grew. I time myself anytime I do things very efficient. Okay.

894
02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:26.039
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: it's it's pressure and lots of pressure. When you do that, but

898
02:09:35.150 --> 02:09:41.090
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Question, okay, really, because it goes through other questions altogether. Okay, they have a question related to this question.

899
02:09:41.420 --> 02:09:47.349
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Yes, yes. So my question is, for this question, what sets you apart from other candidates? Would.

900
02:09:47.490 --> 02:09:52.819
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: But would this be the same as our 30 second elevator peak.

901
02:09:52.820 --> 02:09:53.190
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: No.

902
02:09:53.820 --> 02:09:54.959

Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Very different.

904
02:09:57.470 --> 02:10:10.099
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: This is just something very unique about you, and ideally, that become

905
02:10:10.260 --> 02:10:20.949
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: that matching to the job. So you need to. You need to have idea regarding what job are you applying for? Oh, I'm applying for Google Cloud position. What's such a platform as a candidate, Nancy.

Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I launched very famous cloud product

907
02:10:25.990 --> 02:10:30.970
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: 4 years ago. That as example, right? But if I interview for AI company.

908
02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:33.410
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: what set you apart from other people?

909
02:10:33.610 --> 02:10:35.579
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Why, we even mention cloud product.

910
02:10:35.980 --> 02:10:43.140

911
02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:54.129
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: of the word product product in mind, or what jobs in mind that you what such? And then you and other people applying for the same job

912
02:10:54.540 --> 02:10:58.779
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: was such a powerful as a candidate. So I have an idea of the job in mind.

913
02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:09.650
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Got it. So this would be like like showing your match to the position that you're applying to, and why you're a better match to this position than other candidates.

914
02:11:10.184 --> 02:11:10.719

02:11:40.140 --> 02:11:46.520
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: or like? Mostly it's about PM. Do I volunteer, you know, if not, medium

924
02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:14.980
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Camera. Your camera is on, but your mic is off.

925
02:12:17.190 --> 02:12:18.470
Minyan Jane shen: Sorry.

926
02:12:20.940 --> 02:12:22.280
Minyan Jane shen: I think I

927
02:12:25.500 --> 02:12:28.326
Minyan Jane shen: I will try. I think I'm not really prepared

928
02:12:29.580 --> 02:12:30.200
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay.

929
02:12:32.450 --> 02:12:36.490
Minyan Jane shen: Yeah, so I like most about product management is about.

930
02:12:37.085 --> 02:12:42.449
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Not prepared. Do this one with strength, weakness. Okay.

931
02:12:42.450 --> 02:12:44.170
Minyan Jane shen: Oh, oh, strength! Week! Oh.

932
02:12:44.170 --> 02:12:47.979
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Sunny, sunny. You go for this one. Would you like most and least about pm.

933
02:12:48.767 --> 02:12:51.850
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: yeah, me and you go for the same. What's your strengths and weakness?

934
02:12:53.961 --> 02:13:15.159
Minyan Jane shen: My strength my strength is that I do have technical background. I have I'm a economic Phd, and then I have worked with data, a lot. So so I think I have a strong technical background. And also then, second strength is that I'm easy going person. I would like to communicate with people.

935
02:13:15.360 --> 02:13:28.979
Minyan Jane shen: and 3, rd one, I think, is also related, is like, I have great customer empathy, so that I would like to talk to customers. I also would like to work with other engineer teams to lend the whole

936
02:13:29.684 --> 02:13:40.595
Minyan Jane shen: product Streamline. The one weakness would be, I don't think I have a lot of experience in product management.

937
02:13:41.420 --> 02:13:42.609
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Find a new one.

938
02:13:42.780 --> 02:13:43.710
Minyan Jane shen: Okay,

939
02:13:48.596 --> 02:13:51.663
Minyan Jane shen: so one weakness is

940
02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.069
Minyan Jane shen: I I think.

941
02:14:05.450 --> 02:14:10.550
Minyan Jane shen: I think sometimes can focus too much on details.

942
02:14:11.340 --> 02:14:12.870
Minyan Jane shen: Is that okay?

943
02:14:13.380 --> 02:14:15.820
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Is good over detail, oriented.

944
02:14:16.340 --> 02:14:20.179
Minyan Jane shen: Yeah. So sometimes can be over detailed oriented.

945
02:14:23.230 --> 02:14:26.939
Minyan Jane shen: So I think the way I can

946
02:14:27.080 --> 02:14:47.270
Minyan Jane shen: improve could be definitely while I was like working on some problem, maybe definitely to communicate more with others, so that other people can remind me if I am just going into corners so that so that I can overcome this weakness.

947
02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:51.559
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Good the 1st 3 strengths. I like it.

948
02:14:51.940 --> 02:15:13.089
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Actually, it is your true strength. I feel it sounds so real. And if I look, yeah, that's her strengths. Of course, that kind of thing is is your strengths. I like it actually. You also have some kind of supporting point regarding, I am a very, I'm very have technical backgrounds. You have a Phd also work with data. Also, you have supporting background. It's great. Okay.

949
02:15:13.270 --> 02:15:15.280
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: weakness.

950
02:15:15.820 --> 02:15:24.820
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Nobody should tell the truth of your weakness. Okay, the goal is pass interview.

951
02:15:27.550 --> 02:15:30.350
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: There are lots of people out there with great

952
02:15:30.490 --> 02:15:34.170
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: skills but not able to land a job.

953
02:15:34.450 --> 02:15:37.220
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I'm not saying that they're not good.

954
02:15:38.830 --> 02:15:45.310
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I'm saying that they didn't say the right thing in the interview, so that they just got killed out of nowhere.

955
02:15:46.660 --> 02:15:52.009
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Do not say my weaknesses. I don't have Pm. Experience. You should never say it.

956
02:15:52.340 --> 02:15:55.430
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, do not say lots of things. Just say it just

957
02:15:56.080 --> 02:16:01.020
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: that that age make hurt. Your profile

958
02:16:01.860 --> 02:16:07.180
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: over detail already is great, because over strength equals weakness. Perfect.

959
02:16:08.220 --> 02:16:17.189
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay. But your solution, how to turn it into strength should based on past tense, past tense means.

960
02:16:17.450 --> 02:16:25.070
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, I'm over all over detail oriented. And because I'm I'm someone who's obsessed with all details.

961
02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:33.100
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But I know sometimes over data oriented will will lead to Slowdown. But here is how I have been working on this weakness for a while

962
02:16:33.629 --> 02:16:34.900
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: past tense.

963
02:16:36.129 --> 02:16:46.169
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I always bring in my friends, whatever hold me accountable. Da da. Da. I also did this, and everything you said make a past tense

964
02:16:46.420 --> 02:16:50.979
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I did in the past, and then you talk about brain into present tense. You say

965
02:16:51.530 --> 02:16:56.709
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: that lead to today. I was able to find a good balance between

966
02:16:57.290 --> 02:17:00.410
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: like enough details, make technical decision.

967
02:17:00.860 --> 02:17:04.059
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: but not too much detail to slow down my process.

968
02:17:04.209 --> 02:17:08.830
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Right? Go in the present tense. By regarding what you are able to do today.

969
02:17:10.760 --> 02:17:22.980
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, ideally, you can give proof to show that you already your strength is already because of your your weakness, already become your strength. For example, one, my best one, is, what's your weakness, Nancy?

970
02:17:23.100 --> 02:17:38.470
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: My weakness is my English speaking skills. Oh, because I speak with accent so real, right, it's real. They trust it, it's real. And then they turn it into how I work on my English. Take English pronunciation classes, public speaking classes.

971
02:17:38.580 --> 02:17:39.650
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Today.

Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I became a great public speaker as example. Right? So you have a proof. I'm so much better. Speaking of conferences every single month. That's literally before pandemic. This is what I do. I'm so good. Okay, so you need to make it like, turn to strength. If you have something to prove, this is strength even better.

976
02:18:15.969 --> 02:18:18.010
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, good. Good.

977
02:18:18.501 --> 02:18:24.439
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Very sincere answer. Let me Sunny, what do you like most, and least about Pm.

978
02:18:25.496 --> 02:18:36.259
Sunny Youn: What I like the most about product management is the ability to build a long term product, strategy and vision to help future proof and develop a growth framework for the brand.

979
02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:54.879
Sunny Youn: I've seen the benefit of good product strategy make a difference between 2 x growth and 10 x growth. I believe the right product strategy can really help influence. That. The second thing that I like about being a product manager is the fact that you can really see the satisfaction of helping customers. I've seen how effective

980
02:18:54.879 --> 02:19:22.229
Sunny Youn: advertising campaigns can drive 26 to 54% more revenue for global brands like Coca-cola and Danone and General Mills, and it's truly satisfying to help customers benefit. And then the last thing I like about being a Pm. Is that you have to be on your toes all the time. There's always a different problem. You've got to be innovative and resourceful to come up with ways to compete in the market be more innovative and develop new features.

981
02:19:25.090 --> 02:19:27.759
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: That's what you like, least about pm, or would you.

982
02:19:27.990 --> 02:19:28.299
Sunny Youn: But.

983
02:19:28.309 --> 02:19:30.309
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: The last one, most.

984
02:19:30.309 --> 02:19:34.079
Sunny Youn: Yeah. So I have 3 reasons what I like the most. Right? So one.

985
02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:36.969
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But the most sounds very the 3.rd Most

986
02:19:39.230 --> 02:19:43.039
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I like. We keep on your toes, can we? Can we.

987
02:19:43.670 --> 02:20:04.270
Sunny Youn: Actually, I was. Gonna say, the thing I like the least is there's a lot of unpredictability. So, for example, deep sea came out with a competitive product to compete with Openai and it's not always the case that you can pivot quickly after you've put into place a product execution strategy that takes a long time to develop and re-strategize.

988
02:20:05.960 --> 02:20:16.850
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yes, okay. So we change the keywords a little bit. Always keep on on your toes and change it to what I like. 3rd thing I like most about pm, is

989
02:20:17.220 --> 02:20:21.879
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: it always pushed me to be to work on the cutting edge

990
02:20:22.160 --> 02:20:30.259
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: trend or technology something like that, instead of being on toes, because that sounds a little bit more negative, but being being pushed me to grow on the full.

991
02:20:30.260 --> 02:20:47.929
Sunny Youn: Yeah. So I was saying, like, right? So always pushing to develop new innovation and features and adding in new criteria, like developing AI tools, machine learning tools to deploy against any industry. And so it really helps you be forward thinking.

992
02:20:48.401 --> 02:21:13.699
Sunny Youn: So, yeah, I think. But then is the negative one. The thing I like least is that okay, like, there's always unpredictable environment and circumstances from competitors. And a lot of times product roadmaps are locked in over 6 to 9 months, or even 12 months, and it's very difficult to pivot around quickly and and change and respond to market

993
02:21:14.110 --> 02:21:15.300
Sunny Youn: factors.

994
02:21:21.390 --> 02:21:26.990
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I think it's good one, but I wouldn't use the word in terms of lock lockdown.

995
02:21:27.350 --> 02:21:28.955
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I'll always say

996
02:21:29.950 --> 02:21:43.300
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Don't say lockdown. Basically you say so. Lots of time. We spend lots of effort to create the roadmap, get exactly, buy in. And then all the competition always change that made us to like.

997
02:21:43.950 --> 02:22:06.199
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Just push the directions. Again. That introduced lots of like a scope. Change all the things that we need to actually manage. That's something. And it's also out of control. It's all like deep sea, so good. All the all. The example introduce new model is is my right. My roadmap was perfect.

998
02:22:07.090 --> 02:22:11.680
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: All of a sudden somebody just did something. And now I need to like Redo. The work.

999
02:22:12.470 --> 02:22:16.660
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Right? So that that's fine, would you? Would you? Fine tune? Some keywords is fine.

1000
02:22:17.210 --> 02:22:38.590
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: good, good! You picked the right one. Perfect. Actually, I like it. Why do you want to work in Abcd industry? Let me pick one. Why do you want to work for Abcd Company? What do you see yourself in coming a few years, and we'll talk about homework, and then we're done for today, and then I can check some of the questions we want to repeat some of the questions. Okay, now.

1001
02:22:39.990 --> 02:22:45.920
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I need some volunteers. Go about what you want to work for, ABC industry. At same time, let me use the bathroom 30 seconds. Be right back.

1002
02:22:46.320 --> 02:22:54.280
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I think about if you have answers for one-on-one award for Abcd industry, one-on-one Award for Abcd Company. Okay.

1003
02:23:19.310 --> 02:23:20.470
Ankita Bhargava: Hey, Sunny?

1004
02:23:21.290 --> 02:23:29.340
Ankita Bhargava: By the time Dr. Nancy comes for your question of the least like, could could it be.

1005
02:23:29.900 --> 02:23:34.390
Ankita Bhargava: you know, cutting down the product at the end, despite working.

1006
02:23:34.610 --> 02:23:40.530
Ankita Bhargava: you know, endlessly for 9 months, 10 months, building it. And then said.

1007
02:23:40.530 --> 02:23:54.429
Sunny Youn: Yeah, I think she she covered that because she's basically saying there's a change in scope. So change in scope can include feature creep, which is now we suddenly had to respond to an a new competitor, or if there's a resource constraint.

1008
02:23:54.520 --> 02:24:17.320
Sunny Youn: so, as I did, we had hiring freeze. We can't do all the features we want, and then there's a feature prioritization. But I actually like feature prioritization. I was trying to relay the fact that product roadmaps are so planned and thought through because of the synchronization and alignment with so many cross functional teams. So the minute it changes.

1009
02:24:17.330 --> 02:24:30.389
Sunny Youn: it's it's very difficult to align with marketing and legal and engineering to make those changes quickly, unless you have such a flexible infrastructure that allows you to pivot quickly.

1010
02:24:30.781 --> 02:24:36.200
Sunny Youn: I think that's 1 of the things that I didn't like about product management is this surprises? So.

1011
02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:39.260
Ankita Bhargava: Maybe using the word agile might help.

1012
02:24:40.020 --> 02:24:42.429
Ankita Bhargava: Because I like your answer. I'm just trying to add to it.

1013
02:24:42.430 --> 02:24:43.400
Sunny Youn: Yeah.

1014
02:24:44.010 --> 02:24:44.470
Ankita Bhargava: Editable.

1015
02:24:44.470 --> 02:25:04.180
Sunny Youn: Well, but the thing is, there's agile scrums all the time. So we use that, anyway for prioritization. I think it's it's not. I mean. Yes, everyone uses agile. It's more the fact that there are unpredictable things out of control, that we don't have much capability to react to.

1016
02:25:04.380 --> 02:25:05.710
Ankita Bhargava: Got it. Thank you.

1017
02:25:08.530 --> 02:25:17.309
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Great cool. Yeah. Feel free to share advice with each other. The perfect way to grow. Anyone have prepared answer. Why do you want to work for Abcd Company or ABC. Industry.

1018
02:25:17.530 --> 02:25:18.809
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You want to go over.

1019
02:25:20.630 --> 02:25:26.400
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: If not, we can quickly skip this, too, because because very industry specific.

1020
02:25:27.310 --> 02:25:48.420
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: but get ready for them to ask you those kind of questions. Okay, in real interview, whatever for ABC companies, straightforward, you must talk about the value of company they're proud of. So it's gonna help you to create the answer for the specific company. Do some research. Okay? Stream 2 framework, just pick something that's speak to the heart.

1021
02:25:53.130 --> 02:25:56.439
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: This one I must go live with you guys.

1022
02:25:56.830 --> 02:26:00.839
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Where do you see yourself? In the next 3, 2, 5, 10 years

1023
02:26:01.170 --> 02:26:10.339
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: must ask interview question towards the final interview. Where do you see yourself in the coming 2 years or near term, long term in your career-wise?

1024
02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:19.419
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Whatever you design should make sense in terms of natural progression of your career.

1025
02:26:20.880 --> 02:26:24.610
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: N, it should be reasonable.

1026
02:26:24.950 --> 02:26:26.200
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Your profession.

1027
02:26:26.310 --> 02:26:30.389
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, anyone has. Let me pick someone randomly.

1028
02:26:33.630 --> 02:26:36.470
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: One has spoken yet. Everyone spoke right.

1029
02:26:41.020 --> 02:26:43.720
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Haven't, spoke Ashwaya. I hear.

1030
02:26:45.510 --> 02:26:49.075
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I think she's just missing in

1031
02:26:50.630 --> 02:26:53.520
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and Nika, your camera is on. Why don't you tell me?

1032
02:26:53.750 --> 02:26:55.669
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Where do you see yourself in the next

1033
02:26:56.290 --> 02:27:00.090
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: 2 years? 5 to 10 years? Right? A short term, long term. That's my point.

1034
02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:07.450
Ankita Bhargava: Okay, sounds good. Yeah. So I,

1035
02:27:08.240 --> 02:27:35.019
Ankita Bhargava: okay, Hi, Dr. Nancy, I have an engineering background. And I did my Mba after coming here. So getting a master's isn't something I'd like to do again. But 2 years from now I have a background in data management and cloud security. That's where I'd like to be, and that's where I'd like to move forward, if possible. I would like to go in the Cloud

1036
02:27:35.020 --> 02:27:53.129
Ankita Bhargava: data management space, and I'm already taking the Aipm boot camps. I would like to build more products that align with AI and Cloud data management together. So that's what I'd like to do. 2 years down the line 5 to 10 years.

1037
02:27:53.690 --> 02:27:56.319
Ankita Bhargava: I don't have an answer for that.

1038
02:27:56.320 --> 02:27:59.779
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: This is a mock interview. Can you give me an answer?

1039
02:28:00.310 --> 02:28:29.070
Ankita Bhargava: 5 to 10 years down the line. I'd certainly like to be leading a company wherein I can make a huge impact in terms of revenue, and also the kind of products that I'd like to be in. So the space again, I'd like to stay in the cloud data management space with sprinkles of Ml and AI, because that's what I've learned, and I have the skill set for. So yes, that's.

1040
02:28:29.070 --> 02:28:29.900
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I love it.

1041
02:28:30.760 --> 02:28:52.459
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, I love it. Okay, cool. Basically, the master's no Master's degree. Yes, means a master of something skills or something. Okay. Let me show you guys why I like her answer is, both are good. Okay, so top on long term. First.st But long term you want to hit several key things you want to grow because long term, 10 years later you cannot be in Jack of all trees.

1042
02:28:52.650 --> 02:29:01.019
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So basically, you are the leader, or CEO, maybe CEO San Suhai, or the Director, or something for Abcd. Industry

1043
02:29:01.990 --> 02:29:03.829
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: or ABC domain.

1044
02:29:04.370 --> 02:29:33.070
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: She also said, plus AI cloud, and with the sprinkle of AI, because that's her passion perfect. Okay, near term. She's she's more talking about to me. That's why she oh, I took your af handbook. I want to do this in interview, but but it's a good answer. It's a good answer. But in interview more making like formalized to the interviewer, you can talk about in the near term. I want to like, continue to grow my career as a senior product manager

1045
02:29:33.070 --> 02:29:39.059
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: of the whatever cloud, like a cloud database space. And plus AI,

1046
02:29:39.060 --> 02:30:07.920
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: because AI have been working on my AI skills right now and also start my own AI company and also get certification from Aip and boot camp. Yeah, I want to grow cloud security and and more work towards AI as well, or do the combination between Cloud and AI. That's a perfect intersection where I can leverage my strengths. So you did it. Well, I like your answer with small modification. Don't make it talking to me. Talk to the interviewer, and you can pass into it.

1047
02:30:08.260 --> 02:30:14.900
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Cool. Okay, cool. Let me do. Let me talk about the homework quickly before I do some Q. And A, and repeat some questions.

1048
02:30:17.120 --> 02:30:21.329
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Homework. Answer all the questions in the Pm. Interview questions, database.

1049
02:30:21.790 --> 02:30:24.310
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: random answers to sample 21 answers

1050
02:30:24.530 --> 02:30:26.899
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and find a marketing partner in Discors Channel.

1051
02:30:27.240 --> 02:30:28.210
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: That's the key.

1052
02:30:28.820 --> 02:30:42.399
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay? All those. Okay? So answer all of those integrated. It's all in module to download. But you can get started with my simple answer, help you to write write those. But Pm. Integral questions, database also, I believe that has 60 different questions.

1053
02:30:43.080 --> 02:30:51.210
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, you should answer all of those for practice. But you have 21 some point in, so you can get started with 21 1st before you go up your numbers.

1054
02:30:51.850 --> 02:30:57.349
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, and then find someone to the mock interview. That's also critical because you can help you to implement everything I teach you.

1055
02:30:57.690 --> 02:31:03.640
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, we're here all my coaches here to help you how to improve. But you do the work right. Same thing that you are

1056
02:31:04.190 --> 02:31:07.459
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: your gym. You go to gym, right? You're a personal trainer.

1057
02:31:07.610 --> 02:31:14.559
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Your personal trainers train you, and besides, the time you don't work with personal trainer, you should still go to gym to work out on your own.

1058
02:31:15.010 --> 02:31:19.370
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You should do both. That's why mock interview is important, and you come to see your personal trainer

1059
02:31:19.500 --> 02:31:30.490
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: on in office hours. So you do combo of those. Okay, there's a homework for all of you guys. Oops, that's everything we have. If you have any feedback, let me know. I love to update our content.

1060
02:31:30.840 --> 02:31:44.109
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay, let me take some quick questions. Tanya and Jack and Sunny. And I'm gonna also gonna review your repositioning product question. Okay? Tanya question, what's your question?

1061
02:31:44.320 --> 02:31:52.689
Tanya Milton: So, Dr. Nancy, we were just now talking about AI products. Right? So I just want to understand if we are being interviewed for a traditional Pm role

1062
02:31:53.490 --> 02:32:06.490
Tanya Milton: these days. Mostly many. All the products are AI powered right? So when we're talking about this Gen. AI world, and then AI powered. And then AI agent. So I want to understand us to strike the right balance.

1063
02:32:07.150 --> 02:32:22.969
Tanya Milton: Do we need to like if I'm being interviewed as a traditional pm, right, but I still want to say that. Oh, I want to. I know where we are. We heading to. Right? So how much to talk and how much not to talk like if you can just share a little bit of insight, because

1064
02:32:23.420 --> 02:32:51.669
Tanya Milton: maybe I can just talk. Say, Hey, I want to learn building AI agents right? But then I am not technical, so should we even attempt it, or like, we can just say that, hey, I work on an AI powered product, and in future I look forward to gain some more understanding of Llm. And rag and stuff like that. So what exactly these days should be our approach. When we are a traditional pm, aipm, I understand we need to go deeper. But this is very specific. If we are being interviewed for a traditional Pm. Role.

1065
02:32:54.110 --> 02:33:00.690
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: 1st of all, you shouldn't say in the future. I want to understand. Lm, that's by default. Everyone needs to understand today.

1066
02:33:04.033 --> 02:33:04.930
Tanya Milton: But.

1067
02:33:05.380 --> 02:33:08.380
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: For traditional. Pm, you interview for the website.

1068
02:33:08.630 --> 02:33:12.740
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I need someone to design the e-commerce website for Zara

1069
02:33:12.900 --> 02:33:29.290
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: closing brand right straightforward. Even even the website. I think this AI element AI shop website. Okay, then, let's say, there's a very few product that does not have AI element to it today. So, therefore I will. I will talk about the let's say, let's say, website, Zara website, right?

1070
02:33:29.760 --> 02:33:30.680
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Huh?

1071
02:33:31.290 --> 02:33:34.659
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Ever since A and all this I need to. And let me find a

1072
02:33:35.320 --> 02:33:42.349
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: everything. Has AI any product give me. I can add AI element to it. Okay. But anyway, it's just like, just for the, for the for the website. Pm.

1073
02:33:46.390 --> 02:33:50.395
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: if I interview for the role, I would describe the following,

1074
02:33:50.860 --> 02:33:58.049
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and I understand the traditional Pmo for for website, for Zara, the the closing brand.

1075
02:33:59.660 --> 02:34:09.030
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: The role is, hire me to design the user experience on this website. Right now, I know how in the near term, how to design this

1076
02:34:09.410 --> 02:34:17.329
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: bread and butter. I know this very well. In the, in the midterm and long term. I do want to look into some AI solutions.

1077
02:34:17.710 --> 02:34:41.380
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: because that is potentially going to grow. Our website traffic have even better and more more advanced user experience on our website. Currently, I have been like building my own AI agent and taking AI like Aipm certifications right now, so that when the company is ready I'm ready to take on bigger scope of work.

1078
02:34:41.900 --> 02:34:42.560
Tanya Milton: Hmm.

1079
02:34:43.730 --> 02:34:54.229
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, you can phrase that way whenever you are ready, I'm ready. But even if you don't ask me a personal interest, I've been working on AI Asian and doing my own certification. When you're ready, I'm ready.

1080
02:34:56.510 --> 02:34:57.100
Tanya Milton: Got it.

1081
02:34:57.100 --> 02:35:04.409
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: That's the best way for traditional pm, approach Erin's adding some ais nowadays

1082
02:35:06.090 --> 02:35:12.570
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: it's everywhere, and it's crazy. Crazy. Okay, Jack, question.

1083
02:35:14.550 --> 02:35:27.199
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Yes, so my question is for the the one to 2 year and also 5 year plan for oneself and then, my question is, can we say, like, you know, in 5 to 10 years.

1084
02:35:27.200 --> 02:35:51.890
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: I plan to, you know, start my own company, because, like, you know. In product manager career, I can learn how to launch a product end to end, and that would be helpful for future entrepreneurial attempt for me. Would that be an appropriate answer? Because, like, I was just thinking from the interviewer's perspective, if they recruit you, they want you to stay in the company, and then, you know, work for the company.

1085
02:35:52.040 --> 02:35:52.570
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Thank you both.

1086
02:35:52.570 --> 02:36:03.150
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: No, not 5 to 10 years, I would say 10 plus years is fine. 5 years sounds really short to my own company. 10 year. I don't mind if I'm the business owner

1087
02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:09.760
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: right? And then my team, Mala, come in. What do you want to do? 5 years later I want to start my own company.

1088
02:36:10.650 --> 02:36:14.500
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and then, 10 years ago, one time I come, the other. Yeah, kind of far out.

1089
02:36:15.330 --> 02:36:33.420
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Right? So say what you said, but long longer, sometime in the future, when I start my own company always I always admire to be, aspire, to be entrepreneur, create my own impact, lead the team. 10 years later, after gaining all the skill set, I'd love to become Pm.

1090
02:36:34.060 --> 02:36:36.079
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Episode. I'd love to become entrepreneur

1091
02:36:37.620 --> 02:36:50.249
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: right and then near term or master. Pm. Skill, like 5 years, also want to be the leader of something, whatever different thing. 10 plus years I want. I hope I can start my own company. That's that's that's that's safe.

1092
02:36:50.770 --> 02:37:00.770
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Hmm, got it? Got it that makes sense. And then, yeah, thank you. And then, my next question is also regarding this. I was just not sure like what

1093
02:37:00.860 --> 02:37:21.000
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: the intention of this question is. Cause like, if I'm the interviewer, I'm just thinking like, I just want a capable person who can, you know, do the job of product management. And then you know, a pretty good work, ethic and everything. But why would they care like what your long term personal.

1094
02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.880
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: They want. They want someone to grow with the company.

1095
02:37:27.450 --> 02:37:28.009
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: That's it.

1096
02:37:28.010 --> 02:37:31.689
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I asked the same question. Anybody who who interviews my company

1097
02:37:33.720 --> 02:37:36.710
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: same thing. When I was a director I asked people this

1098
02:37:36.710 --> 02:37:41.069
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: in my team, and when I interview for director, people still ask me the same question.

1099
02:37:41.550 --> 02:37:49.369
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Now I've had my team ask people the same question as well now, and I have deep understanding why nowadays, because we want people to grow with the company.

1100
02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:58.519
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Hmm! So is there maybe like a specific element that they're looking for when they're asking that just like.

1101
02:37:58.873 --> 02:38:10.549
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: They want your growth path to match the company growth path, for example. Sometime in the future. Hopefully, you can. Oh, 10 years down. The, let's say, interviews really become a Google.

1102
02:38:11.430 --> 02:38:14.200
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So 10 years later, I want to.

1103
02:38:14.907 --> 02:38:21.729
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: really be the leader of one of the key like product initiative within Google.

1104
02:38:21.980 --> 02:38:22.570
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Hmm.

1105
02:38:24.010 --> 02:38:28.459
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Because they want you to grow with with the company.

1106
02:38:30.130 --> 02:38:48.150
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Right? You cannot say. 10 years later I want to become CEO. Right? So you want to do well, 10 years later, want to interview with Verizon. I forgot what I said 10 years later. I wish I were already director by them because they need some director 10 years later. Right? So your growth should match the growth with the company. They're looking for.

1107
02:38:48.850 --> 02:38:58.500
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Got it? Got it? Yeah, thank you. My last question is, what are some of the red flags? When answering this question like. Well, there's something we don't say.

1108
02:38:58.870 --> 02:39:03.930
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: The red flag is your your growth doesn't match the company growth.

1109
02:39:04.630 --> 02:39:22.089
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Okay? I said something so stupid earlier when I interviewed, because I can add many interviews. I went out to interview with some CEO of the company or some startup. 2 friends I don't really care. I joined them or not, but I also understand why they, after the CEO around interviews, they never made me offer. They said something so funny. Then they asked me the question.

1110
02:39:22.270 --> 02:39:28.159
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Nancy, if I give you 1 million dollars. Oh, sorry! 10 million dollars! What would you do? I said.

1111
02:39:28.430 --> 02:39:33.489
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I will keep 1 million to myself and donate 9 million dollars to nonprofit.

1112
02:39:34.320 --> 02:40:01.409
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: They were like, why, and then I had like whole thing about nonprofit. And I'm very big on all the nonprofit like. Seriously, I'm big on this, and I will give my money away before I made money. I always give money. I give long stories. I would like to tell the CEO. There's 9 million dollars, you know, so many people need help. I have a series. I'm going to give this kind of organization. Take all the stuff, and it's like all the random stuff they were like. So shocked.

1113
02:40:01.610 --> 02:40:16.899
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You give her 10 million dollars. She's keep 1 million to herself, another 9 million to other people. Oh, I thought she would just like, like, create an amazing technology like start her own company doing some crazy stuff. She's more like, Do

1114
02:40:17.270 --> 02:40:29.310
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: be a philanthropist like crazy stuff, and then she like. Then she couldn't make me an offer just so weird when she joined the company. What she want to do like. So your your career paths

1115
02:40:29.430 --> 02:40:33.220
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: needs align with a company past. That's what we're looking for.

1116
02:40:33.890 --> 02:40:35.320
Kuanglin (Jack) Zhang: Got it. Thank you.

1117
02:40:36.020 --> 02:40:43.569
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, that's that's like, so awkwardly, okay. Now, reflect, I wouldn't hire someone like that if I asked this question in my company

1118
02:40:44.881 --> 02:40:46.129
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: me and question.

1119
02:40:46.130 --> 02:41:05.289
Minyan Jane shen: I think one question is, add on this one. So for, like the short term ones, should we say something specific to the company that we are interviewing like, Oh, in 2 years I would like to lead certain products, for example, but related to this company.

1120
02:41:05.860 --> 02:41:19.569
Minyan Jane shen: Okay? So or like, okay. Another question, I guess, is like you mentioned about this 2 min role. And then are this are, is this 2 min role specific for like this this round, higher manager

1121
02:41:19.790 --> 02:41:24.729
Minyan Jane shen: round or like, because, like the in later ones, when, like there are

1122
02:41:24.900 --> 02:41:29.579
Minyan Jane shen: when we talk about cases, does this 2 min a row also.

1123
02:41:29.580 --> 02:41:31.330
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Behavior, interview, all behaviour.

1124
02:41:31.330 --> 02:41:31.820
Minyan Jane shen: Behaviour.

1125
02:41:31.820 --> 02:41:34.769
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And it's, yeah, yeah, okay, cases are very long.

1126
02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:36.510
Minyan Jane shen: Okay. Okay. Thank you.

1127
02:41:36.510 --> 02:41:37.450
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Cool no problem.

1128
02:41:37.450 --> 02:41:38.030
Vishal Bhoir: Dr.

1129
02:41:38.900 --> 02:41:47.229
Vishal Bhoir: Actually, 1 1 more question like in in the resume, like we are adding, you know, the project which we did for AI boot camp as a startup.

1130
02:41:47.360 --> 02:42:03.679
Vishal Bhoir: But many, many companies. When we interview they ask you about that, because I'm not sure whether it is giving a negative impression in front of them whether you're parallelly working on a startup, even though you are currently employed.

1131
02:42:04.460 --> 02:42:05.180
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh!

1132
02:42:05.180 --> 02:42:05.820
Vishal Bhoir: Yeah.

1133
02:42:07.780 --> 02:42:10.509
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I think is okay.

1134
02:42:10.750 --> 02:42:16.790
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: If you do the Aipm bookcam, because that's the only way. Let's say your traditional Pm.

1135
02:42:18.080 --> 02:42:28.070
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You want to break into AI. That's the only way for people to break into. AI. Let me tell you how right in your current job. There's no opportunity. You have to do a side project break into AI

1136
02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:31.669
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and AI is so hot right now, everyone can do some AI startup. No problem.

1137
02:42:31.830 --> 02:42:38.140
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: because that's the only way to break into AI, right? And let's say you are

1138
02:42:38.270 --> 02:42:43.680
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: doing cloud. Pm, you want to continue to grow a cloud. Pm. Track

1139
02:42:43.840 --> 02:42:50.450
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: right? And then I wouldn't say I have like a startup on the side. It's kind of awkward.

1140
02:42:52.350 --> 02:42:58.810
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So think about your how your star story is going to fit into the story

1141
02:42:59.320 --> 02:43:02.570
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you want to tell to the interviewer.

1142
02:43:05.770 --> 02:43:06.170
Vishal Bhoir: Okay.

1143
02:43:06.170 --> 02:43:07.670
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Sense to you, Michelle.

1144
02:43:08.205 --> 02:43:15.169
Vishal Bhoir: Yeah. But I guess there are some positions in companies which doesn't

1145
02:43:15.400 --> 02:43:22.410
Vishal Bhoir: need AI background. But I feel like AI as an and

1146
02:43:22.610 --> 02:43:30.630
Vishal Bhoir: like advantage, profile, kind of thing. If we submit the resume with the AI experience and the AI startup.

1147
02:43:30.630 --> 02:43:33.349
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, I see you should. You should definitely add it. Yeah.

1148
02:43:33.350 --> 02:43:45.470
Vishal Bhoir: Okay. But they might be having an impression like, you know, the current position which they are hiring doesn't need AI. But this guy is having AI background as well as he is doing startup. So that should not.

1149
02:43:45.470 --> 02:43:46.840
Vishal Bhoir: No, it's fine.

1150
02:43:46.960 --> 02:44:16.180
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It's fine, because during the interview they will definitely ask you, are you still working on your AI startup? Are you once in a job. I continue working on it. You're like, Oh, this is my AI startup, because, you know the hype of AI. I'm very excited. I started working on AI startup. But my scope is very small because a small startup, I'd rather join a bigger company and create the AI startup in-house for the company to impact lots of people. So I don't plan to continue my startup. Once I land this ABC job.

1151
02:44:17.280 --> 02:44:21.860
Vishal Bhoir: So you, you say, like that right? I will not continue my startup if I get the job.

1152
02:44:21.900 --> 02:44:32.579
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: All they care is, are you going to have 2 jobs? Once you start your job, your full-time job.

1153
02:44:33.610 --> 02:44:34.420
Vishal Bhoir: Okay.

1154
02:44:36.150 --> 02:44:37.080
Vishal Bhoir: Hmm.

1155
02:44:37.290 --> 02:44:41.890
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: They want your full dedication to your new job instead of having multiple jobs.

1156
02:44:42.190 --> 02:44:49.690
Vishal Bhoir: So you can say, like, this is my like, part, time, weekend kind of activity working on the startup. Will that? Okay?

1157
02:44:50.620 --> 02:44:54.589
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Right now. Yes, but after you learn in your job you

1158
02:44:54.950 --> 02:45:09.130
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: to stop it, because you feel it better to put your effort into your new company to create amazing, impressive AI product or any product to impact more people's life because your company is not scalable.

1159
02:45:10.810 --> 02:45:22.370
Vishal Bhoir: Okay? So they would say, like, you know, since this is your dream kind of passion working on this startup, you are easily giving up on that. Just for this position.

1160
02:45:22.370 --> 02:45:27.669
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: No, you say no, because I'm going to work on AI product within the new job.

1161
02:45:28.550 --> 02:45:29.550
Vishal Bhoir: Okay. And you can.

1162
02:45:29.550 --> 02:45:30.270
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Company.

1163
02:45:30.270 --> 02:45:33.630
Vishal Bhoir: That new job doesn't have AI background. So.

1164
02:45:34.670 --> 02:45:36.770
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Eventually they'll have it. Right? So

1165
02:45:37.320 --> 02:45:42.039
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: let's say, it's a cloud cloud in Google, right? What company does have? AI think about it?

1166
02:45:42.640 --> 02:45:45.339
Vishal Bhoir: There are some banks who doesn't really yet.

1167
02:45:46.570 --> 02:45:47.960
Vishal Bhoir: Unfortunately.

1168
02:45:48.490 --> 02:45:50.709
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I think they get it replaced soon.

1169
02:45:50.820 --> 02:45:53.659
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Let's say you join Citibank.

1170
02:45:54.180 --> 02:45:58.450
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: We don't use AI today. AI replace people's jobs. We don't do AI,

1171
02:45:58.580 --> 02:46:15.490
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: you're doing whatever cloud product for AI Cloud product for Citibank right now and then you have an AI startup on the side. They'll ask you. Oh, tell me more about AI Startup. Oh, do the weekend thing I'm trying to fulfill my passion is, Oh, what are you going to do after you land this job?

1172
02:46:16.230 --> 02:46:26.559
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And said, Yeah, I want to fully dedicate into my new job. And close my startup. And the reason is, I found out my startup is not as scalable.

1173
02:46:27.220 --> 02:46:32.549
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And there's a big differences between scaling a product versus starting a product

1174
02:46:32.700 --> 02:46:36.289
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: which is true. You can start a project. Don't make money, you close it down

1175
02:46:37.610 --> 02:47:01.599
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: right straightforward. And I discovered this. My startup is not scalable, so not scalable, the return investment is low. So therefore, I like to focus on the companies that have bright futures or can create product impact millions of people's lives.

1176
02:47:02.340 --> 02:47:03.840
Vishal Bhoir: Okay. Okay.

1177
02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:08.399
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And eventually, hopefully, if there's any internal opportunity work on AI product that'll be even better.

1178
02:47:09.360 --> 02:47:10.700
Vishal Bhoir: You can see it this way.

1179
02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:12.470
Vishal Bhoir: Okay, okay, okay.

1180
02:47:12.700 --> 02:47:28.019
Vishal Bhoir: thank you. Another one is like, you know, the 3 phase you know, launch, say, like end to end ideation. Mvp and launch right since my background is mostly in corporate wearing.

1181
02:47:28.240 --> 02:47:42.209
Vishal Bhoir: we. Whatever I have done is mostly kind of A, b 2 b, you know, wearing, I take ideation, Mvp, but there is no per se launch, because it was mostly used by the employees in the company.

1182
02:47:42.850 --> 02:47:46.749
Vishal Bhoir: So what should we describe more in the launch phase.

1183
02:47:47.780 --> 02:48:13.649
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Your customer is the internal employee of the customer. During the Gtm. When I launched this Abcd workflow application for our end customers, we use the following Gtm approach in 3 phases, phase number one, we decide to test out within a small group of as employees, like a sales department employee within the company.

1184
02:48:13.650 --> 02:48:23.030
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: and then it was in phase 2, where, after we 6 received 90% success of the sales department, we went to. I don't know

1185
02:48:23.310 --> 02:48:26.540
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: customer support department, or

1186
02:48:26.800 --> 02:48:36.900
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: we went to the entire department within the entire company. So all employees using that and phase 3 will continue to provide end-to-end lifecycle support, such as

1187
02:48:37.200 --> 02:48:46.190
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: training maintenance. To ensure that this product is successful after launch, as well.

1188
02:48:47.640 --> 02:48:49.099
Vishal Bhoir: Okay, that's helpful. Yeah.

1189
02:48:49.160 --> 02:48:51.460
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Say something like that.

1190
02:48:51.740 --> 02:48:54.170
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, cool. Thank you.

1191
02:48:55.260 --> 02:48:58.320
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Great sunny. Let me review your

1192
02:48:59.654 --> 02:49:02.579
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: reposition, your product. And then.

1193
02:49:02.820 --> 02:49:11.860
Sunny Youn: I'm not so sure how often that question will be asked, so I prepared it also to answer, what's been your most challenging project.

1194
02:49:12.310 --> 02:49:12.990
Sunny Youn: So.

1195
02:49:13.970 --> 02:49:40.130
Sunny Youn: thank you for that question. I think one of the recent examples of how I was able to reposition a product was shifting the go to market strategy from teaching our customers how to or selling them fish, but to teaching them how to fish for themselves as the global head of marketing analytics at Amazon. We were focused on delivering marketing analytics services

1196
02:49:40.330 --> 02:49:49.239
Sunny Youn: as a dedicated work for hire custom reporting, and we shifted them into positioning it as a self service analytics tool.

1197
02:49:49.905 --> 02:50:05.870
Sunny Youn: The reason that we did this is because we were hiring analysts, and our team had ballooned to 150. And yet there was a backlog of incoming requests. As a result of some data analysis, we found 60% of these incoming requests were very similar.

1198
02:50:06.140 --> 02:50:27.079
Sunny Youn: and in addition, it was very difficult for our analysts to handle scaling globally, meaning. It was very difficult for someone in the Us. To solve Japanese account team questions, and also Turkey, because of the language problems and not understanding the local market. And last, but not least.

1199
02:50:30.170 --> 02:50:46.819
Sunny Youn: There was some element of wanting to deliver career growth to our data scientist teams because they were doing the same problems over and over again. So in alignment with the sales, teams and engineering resources and go to market.

1200
02:50:47.130 --> 02:51:02.259
Sunny Youn: We redesigned our services as a thought leadership and training program where we would teach our clients and their data science teams how to use the analytic templates that we created for them to solve for some of their marketing

1201
02:51:02.710 --> 02:51:21.239
Sunny Youn: performance, reporting by themselves. And it was very successful, because in the end it was a business transformation where we were able to free up resources and also drive customer satisfaction by teaching customers how to learn how to use their own analytic tools.

1202
02:51:22.230 --> 02:51:22.579
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Thank you.

1203
02:51:22.580 --> 02:51:27.099
Sunny Youn: Long winded. But I mean, the point was, I was. I didn't want to get technical based on.

1204
02:51:27.100 --> 02:51:27.520
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Feedback.

1205
02:51:27.520 --> 02:51:28.630
Sunny Youn: From earlier.

1206
02:51:28.810 --> 02:51:29.220
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: His job.

1207
02:51:29.620 --> 02:51:47.569
Sunny Youn: A change in go to market positioning. So instead of selling them fish, we're teaching you how to fish. Before there was a bottleneck we had a backlog of like a thousand questions, and it's the same question from different countries how to improve the return on investment, etc, etc.

1208
02:51:47.700 --> 02:51:54.879
Sunny Youn: So instead of hiring more people, and anyway, we had a hiring freeze. So we were also backlogged from an operation standpoint.

1209
02:51:55.400 --> 02:52:07.519
Sunny Youn: So we needed to. So the context, if we didn't reposition, we wouldn't be able to deliver what we promised, anyway, that we had to reposition it in order to continue to satisfy our client. Needs

1210
02:52:07.710 --> 02:52:22.150
Sunny Youn: and clients were also hiring their own data science teams, and it gave them a lot of privilege to say they partnered and completed a Amazon certification course to help with their own career, growth and enhancement. Those.

1211
02:52:22.150 --> 02:52:27.640
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You should add this Amazon's vacation course whatever to to original talk track as well. I like it.

1212
02:52:27.640 --> 02:52:34.289
Sunny Youn: Yeah. And then, actually, it was successful in the end, because the positioning became part of our

1213
02:52:34.710 --> 02:52:42.540
Sunny Youn: incentive program for agencies as a thought leadership component of negotiating global contracts.

1214
02:52:43.980 --> 02:52:45.280
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Cool. I like it.

1215
02:52:45.580 --> 02:52:46.440
Sunny Youn: Oh, good!

1216
02:52:46.990 --> 02:52:48.639
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: I like it.

1217
02:52:49.360 --> 02:52:52.270
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: To frank your explanation. Make it better.

1218
02:52:52.930 --> 02:52:53.420
Sunny Youn: Hmm.

1219
02:52:54.040 --> 02:52:57.989
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Is a way to add some of the keywords there. Not all of it.

1220
02:52:59.300 --> 02:53:03.990
Sunny Youn: Yeah, I think it's more natural when I explain well, so I think it has been powerful

1221
02:53:04.170 --> 02:53:08.690
Sunny Youn: to give the context. If you don't have the solution. There's a big problem.

1222
02:53:08.800 --> 02:53:12.059
Sunny Youn: And I learned that from previous feedback. So

1223
02:53:12.250 --> 02:53:20.860
Sunny Youn: I think stating, getting to the point, which is, it's about shifting the mindset from dedicated service to self-service.

1224
02:53:21.170 --> 02:53:24.045
Sunny Youn: the bottleneck, and then self.

1225
02:53:25.790 --> 02:53:33.840
Sunny Youn: certification is, it was the key shift in the product. So that's what I wanted to quickly get to the point instead.

1226
02:53:33.840 --> 02:53:38.190
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You should, you should use the keywords you said I was able to shift

1227
02:53:38.420 --> 02:53:54.780
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: from, like whatever everything in-house into self serve, and also ship the bottleneck to whatever new keywords you said say this at the beginning I was able to do the foreign chain. 2 things. 2 things here is how I did it.

1228
02:53:57.050 --> 02:54:00.530
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, you you pick better keywords later on, when you expand this.

1229
02:54:00.920 --> 02:54:06.449
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And I can, so that you will make the contrast more obvious.

1230
02:54:06.950 --> 02:54:15.580
Sunny Youn: Right. And so that's the thing, even though they don't ask this question about how did you reposition a product? If the question is, what's the most challenging

1231
02:54:16.079 --> 02:54:23.019
Sunny Youn: problem that you have faced. This was actually very challenging because you had to align with the sales team. You had to get the

1232
02:54:23.460 --> 02:54:42.159
Sunny Youn: marketing team, because before it's like we'll serve you a black box solution. Any question you have, we'll solve it for you, and they don't need to know to now we're going to train you to learn how to pull your own data and analyze it for yourself. So there needed to be alignment from marketing. And then engineering.

1233
02:54:42.290 --> 02:54:47.790
Sunny Youn: I mean, it's the same data warehouse. But we had to build a an Api Hub

1234
02:54:48.386 --> 02:54:52.400
Sunny Youn: that had the applications built into it instead of

1235
02:54:52.980 --> 02:55:04.739
Sunny Youn: basically, the scientists like pulling the data and regurgitating the report over and over again. There's no satisfaction either. The senior level people are like, again, another baby diaper report.

1236
02:55:05.500 --> 02:55:11.860
Sunny Youn: Oh, my God! So even for internal career growth prospects, it was

1237
02:55:12.560 --> 02:55:19.650
Sunny Youn: shifting the execution to self-service product and

1238
02:55:19.960 --> 02:55:31.600
Sunny Youn: allowing data scientists to focus on the edge cases that were truly unique and intellectually challenging. While shifting the operations to self serve automation. So I think, from a.

1239
02:55:31.600 --> 02:55:32.060
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: That's.

1240
02:55:32.060 --> 02:55:38.800
Sunny Youn: Standpoint. It. It covered many things right, the career growth, the resource, allocation, customer and cross functional.

1241
02:55:40.380 --> 02:55:43.490
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: To answer the most challenging question. You cannot use

1242
02:55:43.670 --> 02:55:47.630
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: the original like the script, we need to change it a little bit.

1243
02:55:48.880 --> 02:55:54.620
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Can you? Can you answer, use the same story to answer? What's your most challenging project? Work on

1244
02:55:54.780 --> 02:55:55.420
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: 2 min.

1245
02:55:55.420 --> 02:56:07.779
Sunny Youn: One of the most challenging questions was to design a go to market strategy that could shift the product positioning from dedicated self to self service, delivery.

1246
02:56:08.340 --> 02:56:09.280
Sunny Youn: And

1247
02:56:09.840 --> 02:56:27.160
Sunny Youn: the most challenging thing was to align with cross functional teams in sales, marketing, and engineering, to design an operational workflow and sales rhythm that enabled customers to pull the data and find out their marketing science

1248
02:56:27.590 --> 02:56:29.790
Sunny Youn: recommendations by themselves

1249
02:56:30.360 --> 02:56:48.369
Sunny Youn: and enable them to develop thought, leadership and training with their own sales with their own analysts versus facing the bottleneck of not being able to hire enough resources to satisfy the tremendous demand and need for

1250
02:56:48.900 --> 02:56:49.990
Sunny Youn: questions.

1251
02:56:53.660 --> 02:56:56.480
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: You should still use the Grail framework.

1252
02:56:56.850 --> 02:57:08.915
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, the most challenging thing I had was the background information. When I was working on whatever creating Amazon, creating whatever data science, back box solutions.

1253
02:57:10.900 --> 02:57:22.839
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: this was the most challenging one was because I focus on self-serve to change everything to self-serve with limited resources. And then how I do it is, I decided, Abcd things.

1254
02:57:24.350 --> 02:57:33.919
Sunny Youn: yeah, after. So the hardest thing for me is deciding which framework for which question because I have so many frameworks memorized, now, I don't know which one to apply.

1255
02:57:34.232 --> 02:57:37.359
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: This one, tell me a time is always Grail framework.

1256
02:57:37.360 --> 02:57:39.919
Sunny Youn: Okay, for behavioral.

1257
02:57:39.920 --> 02:57:47.070
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: True behavior. Right? So if they ask you what is the most challenging product you work on.

1258
02:57:48.236 --> 02:57:52.389
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Then it is the 3 by 2 framework which is similar to what you said.

1259
02:57:52.820 --> 02:57:55.329
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: But except you didn't tell us.

1260
02:57:55.570 --> 02:57:57.230
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: what product do you work on?

1261
02:57:58.180 --> 02:58:20.900
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So yeah, the most challenging product I work on is Amazon. Whatever database transitioning product. And at Amazon we are serving fortunate companies, data scientists to do ABC things. We balloon our team. It's so successful. White boxing solution with group 150 people. But

1262
02:58:21.650 --> 02:58:27.249
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: there there is. But it was the most challenging thing to do was because whatever you said.

1263
02:58:27.490 --> 02:58:28.070
Sunny Youn: Yeah.

1264
02:58:28.070 --> 02:58:37.309
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And then another team to execute you can. You can cut through the all the it's 3 by 2 framework. But you need to add the context, what product you work on.

1265
02:58:39.150 --> 02:58:46.640
Sunny Youn: Yeah, yeah, so it's the analytic marketing reporting, and decisioning.

1266
02:58:46.740 --> 02:59:02.249
Sunny Youn: so typically, yes, so historically, we would have dedicated black box, scientists doing whatever the client asks. And we found out 60% of the questions were similar globally, and our analysts weren't capable of

1267
02:59:02.550 --> 02:59:23.059
Sunny Youn: localizing it to 16 global markets from Brazil to Japan. And there was also bottleneck because of the tremendous demand for these custom services. So we shifted the responsibility to customers by enabling sales teams to train and certify

1268
02:59:23.200 --> 02:59:28.090
Sunny Youn: clients, data, science teams to pull the report themselves.

1269
02:59:29.250 --> 02:59:30.769
Sunny Youn: Something like that.

1270
02:59:31.550 --> 02:59:33.849
Sunny Youn: I have to write it down.

1271
02:59:33.850 --> 02:59:34.290
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: It done.

1272
02:59:34.290 --> 02:59:36.979
Sunny Youn: Yeah, the concepts are kind of there, you know.

1273
02:59:37.260 --> 02:59:37.870
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah.

1274
02:59:38.479 --> 02:59:43.689
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: write it down. I think your 1st version is better, except you didn't tell us the context.

1275
02:59:44.550 --> 02:59:45.370
Sunny Youn: Hmm.

1276
02:59:46.690 --> 02:59:47.460
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, he's true.

1277
02:59:47.460 --> 02:59:49.409
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Write it down, organize a little bit.

1278
02:59:49.410 --> 02:59:54.929
Sunny Youn: It was. I mean, the main context is the hiring freeze. It was a bottleneck, so

1279
02:59:55.330 --> 03:00:10.189
Sunny Youn: I mean, you could say that people wanted to I mean the clients wanted it, but it was more internally driven than externally driven. But anyway, it turned out to be satisfying to the clients because they wanted to train their own people and up level them.

1280
03:00:10.190 --> 03:00:21.309
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, you can just say, well, we created such amazing ABC data product. However, due to internal reason, Amazon has hiring freezes, you know lots of big time hiring freeze.

1281
03:00:21.889 --> 03:00:33.759
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: We. We cannot meet our fulfillment, and as some data we have over 100 customers sign up, we're not able to meet their meet, their or fulfill what we promised to do.

1282
03:00:34.360 --> 03:00:47.039
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: And and on top of that we also start to explore different opportunities, and we discover 4 new things. Number one. The clients want to grow the data science team number 2,

1283
03:00:47.320 --> 03:00:50.849
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: 80 or 60% of the tickets

1284
03:00:51.140 --> 03:00:57.129
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: coming from from 16 different countries. We just couldn't support it. Number 3.

1285
03:00:57.600 --> 03:01:00.120
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh, with others, I decided to say.

1286
03:01:00.260 --> 03:01:04.810
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: fully reposition, a product from black box solution into self-serve.

1287
03:01:05.190 --> 03:01:07.490
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: So that they can make it like the Radha.

1288
03:01:07.490 --> 03:01:11.359
Sunny Youn: Yeah, I think black box is better than dedicated.

1289
03:01:11.360 --> 03:01:11.870
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah.

1290
03:01:11.870 --> 03:01:12.570
Sunny Youn: Yeah.

1291
03:01:12.570 --> 03:01:14.810
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Yeah, your black box solution sounds sounds great.

1292
03:01:14.810 --> 03:01:16.409
Sunny Youn: It's easier to. Yeah.

1293
03:01:16.410 --> 03:01:17.200
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Understand.

1294
03:01:17.200 --> 03:01:18.510
Sunny Youn: Okay. Thank you.

1295
03:01:18.510 --> 03:01:22.569
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: No problem. Yeah. Just organize the answer. You'll be good. Okay, great

1296
03:01:22.680 --> 03:01:51.000
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: cool. Looks like, answer all my questions. Great and best luck. Everybody for upcoming interview feel free to come to our additional office. I'll review answers as well for anybody. Please attend my tomorrow. Monday, one Pm. Est Webinar feedback session. We we need to completely redesign the webinar. I want to hear your feedback. Okay, great, cool, cool. All right. Good night. See, you guys, let us know how we can improve the teaching.

1297
03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:53.690
Vishal Bhoir: Thank you. Last question.

1298
03:01:53.940 --> 03:01:54.490
Dr. Nancy Li @PM Accelerator: Oh!

1299
03:01:55.219 --> 03:02:02.040
